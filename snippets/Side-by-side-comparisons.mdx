## What Are Side-by-Side Comparisons?

Side-by-side comparisons are a method for visually displaying the differences between two documents by showing both the original and modified versions simultaneously. Changes are highlighted directly in each document, with deletions marked in the original document and insertions in the modified document.

In Draftable Legal, side-by-side comparisons make it easy to identify document changes by presenting the two documents in parallel. It also provides additional tools such as synced scrolling and a change list for an efficient review process.

## Limitations of Side-by-Side Comparisons:

Despite their usefulness, side-by-side comparisons also have some limitations:
