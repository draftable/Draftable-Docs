## Configuring Draftable Legal settings via Group Policy

Draftable Legal offers a range of Group Policy settings for license deployment, application configuration and update management. More information is documented [here](/hc/en-us/articles/18763487262105-Configuring-settings-with-Group-Policy-Draftable-Legal).

## Downloading specific versions of the installers 

Users can download specific versions of the installer files if they wish to install a specific version. The format schema for these direct links to a specific version takes the following form:

```bash
https://dl.draftable.com/desktop/DraftableDesktop<type>Setup-<version>.exe
```

Where **`<version>`** represents the version number you wish to download, and **`<type>`** indicates the type of installer you want to download.

For example, if you wanted to download the default installer version 2.16.100, the link would appear as below:

```bash
https://dl.draftable.com/desktop/DraftableDesktopSetup-2.16.100.exe
```

Lastly, if you wanted to download a machine-wide installer, version 2.13.100, the link would appear as below

```bash
https://dl.draftable.com/desktop/DraftableDesktopSystem-2.13.000.msi
```

## Draftable Legal Installer for enterprise deployments

For deployments in enterprise environments, the default installer for Draftable Legal may not be suitable. Draftable Legal offers two alternative installers: a per-user MSI installer and a machine-wide MSI installer.

Each installer has trade-offs, different recommended deployment scenarios, advantages, and installation steps.

### Default Installer

**Installer Type:** Regular executable (.exe)

**Installer Scope:** Per-user

**Requires Admin:** No

**Recommended scenarios:** Individual users, small-scale deployments

**Download URL:** [https://dl.draftable.com/desktop/DraftableDesktopSetup.exe](https://dl.draftable.com/desktop/DraftableDesktopSetup.exe)

This installer is recommended for most scenarios and is the default installer provided. It's the easiest to use and has minimal requirements - ideal for individual users.

#### Benefits

- No administrator privileges are required for installation
- Updates are automatically applied

#### Notes

- Each user on the system needs to run the installer (per-user deployment)
- Each user maintains their own copy of the product

#### Installation
<Steps>
    <Step>
    Run the installer
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Follow the prompts, which will include selecting the install location and entering the product key
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Draftable Desktop is installed and ready to use
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Machine-Wide MSI

**Also Known As:** Native MSI, Per-Machine MSI

**Installer Type:** MSI (Windows Installer)

**Installer Scope:** System

**Requires Admin:** Yes 

**Recommended scenarios:** Citrix & Remote Desktop Services deployments, high-security environments 

**Download URL:** [https://dl.draftable.com/desktop/DraftableDesktopSystem.msi](https://dl.draftable.com/desktop/DraftableDesktopSystem.msi)

This installer is only recommended for specific deployment scenarios where the other installers are unsuitable. The most common scenario is Microsoft RDS and Citrix deployments where a single shared installation is desired, typically for storage efficiency.

  
This installer is a "true" system-wide installer, unlike the Per-User MSI. The software is installed to a  
system-wide location and can be launched by all users of the system, including concurrently as in RDS  
and Citrix deployments.

#### Benefits

- A single installation can be shared by all users on that machine
- Administrators have the control to manage updates
- Offers support for concurrent usage by multiple users on that machine

#### Notes

- Administrator rights are required for the initial installation and updates
- All product updates must be manually downloaded and installed
- System dependencies must be manually installed (e.g. .NET)
