## The problem: Reviewing changes in context is painful

When reviewing redlined documents, it can sometimes be hard to understand the intention behind a change. Many lawyers rely on having their older and newer documents open in other programs to be able to quickly review the context in which changes were made. The problem with this 'context switching' is it takes effort to find the right section of an input document, and even more concentration to connect that context to what is seen in your Redlined comparison output.

## The solution: Three-Pane View

From Draftable v2.15.100, users can now see switch the viewer mode to show the older, newer and redlined documents in one screen. This **Three Pane View** mode includes 'sync scrolling' across all documents shown, meaning you won't have to manually look for the right page of each document to complete your review. This guide provides a high level overview of how to use the 3-Pane View feature.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    In Draftable, **load your input files** into the **New Comparison Window**,
    select the **Redline (.pdf)** and hit **Compare**

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Once the comparison is complete the **Draftable Viewer** will open. In the
    viewer ribbon menu selec the **Three Pane** command (pictured).
    <Note>
      **Note:** The Three Pane ribbon menu option will appear 'greyed out' until
      the view is available. This may occur as the redline view is generated
      before the three pane view. If the option is greyed out, please wait for
      it to be enabled.

  <Step>
    As you move any document (older, newer or redline), the other two will 'sync
    scroll' to the relevant section to allow easy review of changes in context.
