## Draftable for Office Workflow

The Draftable for Office workflow integrates directly into Microsoft Word, allowing you to compare open documents, recent files, and versions — without needing to leave Word.  
The add-in opens a **Draftable interface panel** on the right-hand side of the Word window, where users can select files, run comparisons, and view results.

### Workflow options using Draftable within Word

Under the **Home** tab, you’ll find 4 primary buttons, which are all explained below. 

<Note>
**Please note:** 

Ensure that **Draftable is open in the background** when using Draftable for office, otherwise documents will not be loaded correctly or at all into Draftable. 
</Note>

#### 1. Compare Open Documents

The **Compare Open** option lists all documents currently open in all instances of Word, allowing you to quickly select two to compare. This is useful when working on multiple files simultaneously within Word.

Once you have clicked "Compare Selected", it will open the chosen documents into the Draftable New comparison window.

#### 2. Compare Versions

The **Compare Versions** feature allows you to easily compare different versions of the same document, ideal for version-controlled files (e.g., from iManage, NetDocuments, or SharePoint).

You can also **refresh versions** if a new version has been saved or published.

Just like the other comparison modes, the documents will open into the Draftable New comparison window.
