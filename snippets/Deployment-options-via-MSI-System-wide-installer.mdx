<Note>The iManage HTTP Listener Service requires more configuration beyond that is setup in this article. The steps in this article merely deploys the Listener Service, but for complete configuration [please see here.](/hc/en-us/articles/33978111642905-Alternative-iManage-HTTP-listener-service-installation-guide-for-Draftable-Legal)</Note>

## Custom MSI deployment via scripted automated installs

The following steps are suitable for administrators deploying Draftable Desktop via a command line interface, InTune or similar. It outlines how to programmatically control features being installed by the MSI via the well-known [ADDLOCAL property (link to Microsoft Learn page)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/addlocal).  This allows administrators to provide a comma-separated list of features to be installed.

<Warning>
**Planning to use iManage?** If your organization intends to use iManage integration with Draftable Legal, it is strongly recommended that you include the HTTP Listener Service (`HttpListener`) in your deployment. This service is required for iManage integration to function correctly. For complete iManage configuration, please refer to the [iManage HTTP Listener Service installation guide](/hc/en-us/articles/33978111642905-Alternative-iManage-HTTP-listener-service-installation-guide-for-Draftable-Legal).
</Warning>

The features available for specification are listed in the table below

| Feature name ("Title") | Feature ID ("Feature") |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Draftable for Outlook | OutlookAddin |
| Draftable for Word | WordAddin |
| Draftable for Excel | ExcelAddin |
| Desktop | DesktopShortcut |
| Start Menu | StartMenuShortcut |
| iManage HTTP Listener Service | HttpListener |

Use the ADDLOCAL property to programmatically specify which 'Features' are installed by the MSI by listing the Feature ID (see table above). *Note, this property specifies what IS INSTALLED. Features absent from this property will NOT be installed.*

### Basic command - MSI installation

Below is a **basic** example of how to install Draftable via a command line. This example shows installation without the Outlook add-in but including the Word and Excel add-ins and the two shortcuts and the iManage HTTP Listener Service.

```bash
msiexec /i DraftableDesktopSystem.msi ADDLOCAL=StartMenuShortcut,DesktopShortcut,HttpListener,WordAddin,ExcelAddin
```

Based on the above, running the installer would result in the following Advanced UI set-up:

### Advanced command - MSI installation

If you wanted a more complex configuration that specifies: 

- The install location
- Multiple Draftable add-ins
- HTTP listener service for imanage
- Quiet/silent installation
- Specify no machine restart after installation
- Verbose logging of the full install. **Recommended** if you are having issues with certain components not installing correctly.

The command below is more **advanced** with demonstrates more options during installation.

```powershell
Start-Process msiexec -ArgumentList '/i "DraftableDesktopSystem.msi" ADDLOCAL=StartMenuShortcut,DesktopShortcut,HttpListener,WordAddin,ExcelAddin,OutlookAddin INSTALLDIR="C:\Program Files (x86)\Draftable" /qn /norestart /L*V "C:\Logs\draftable_install.log"' -Wait
```

For logging to work, please ensure you create the logging location **prior** to installation. This command will also wait to complete before returning to the command line, that way you know when the installation is completed.

## Troubleshooting Add-in Installation Issues

If Office Add-ins are not loading correctly after MSI installation, this may be due to the LoadBehavior registry value not being set correctly. For troubleshooting steps, see [Office Add-ins Not Loading After MSI Installation](/hc/en-us/articles/53125847291673-Office-Add-ins-Not-Loading-After-MSI-Installation).
