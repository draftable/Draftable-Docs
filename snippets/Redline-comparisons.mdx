## What are Redline Comparisons?

Redline comparisons are a method to visually display the differences between two documents by highlighting the changes directly in the text within a single document view.

In Draftable Legal, Redline comparisons show deleted, inserted, and moved text with distinct formatting and colors that make it easy to identify modifications at a glance. Additionally Draftable Legal also offers a  Redline comparison output as Tracked Changes Word document.

Each of these output methods each contain their own options for specific outputs. These combinations are discussed below:

- **Redline PDF/DOCX:** This output shows the newer document and marks up all changes on top of that in the Redline view
- **Changed Pages PDF:** This output shows only the changed pages between the older and newer document. It marks up all changes in the changed pages as a Redline view
- **Tracked Changes:** This output is an MS Office document with the changes shown in Track Changes (a Microsoft Office feature)
- **Changes report:** An output that generates a document that contains all changes within a series of tables, making it easy to quickly see what specifically has changed between the documents.
- **CSV Change Report:** Export the changes into a CSV file for detailed analysis or record-keeping.

## Benefits of Redline Comparisons:

Redline comparisons in Draftable offer several benefits, including:

1. Clarity: By displaying the changes directly in the text, Redline comparisons provide a clear and easy-to-understand representation of the differences between the two documents.
2. Efficiency: As Redline comparisons show changes in a single page, this enables users to quickly identify and review changes, which can be more efficient compared to side-by-side comparisons.
3. Customization: Draftable allows users to [customize the formatting and colors](/hc/en-us/articles/16549612535705-Redline-comparison-settings) (markup schema) used in Redline comparisons, ensuring that the display meets their specific preferences and requirements.

## Limitations of Redline Comparisons:

Despite their benefits, Redline comparisons also have some limitations:

1. Complexity: In documents with a high number of changes or complex formatting, Redline comparisons may become difficult to read and navigate.
2. Non-Text Elements: Redline comparisons primarily focus on text changes
3. Missing context: Redline changes cannot provide the full context of a change in the same way as a side by side output, making some changes harder to interpret
