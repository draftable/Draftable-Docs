## Using Draftable Redline in Email

### Reply workflow - If you intend to Redline an Email or Accept and Reject changes 

<Steps>
    <Step>
    To get started, you will first need to open an **existing email** and hit the **reply/reply** **all** button.  
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-redline/image-1.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Perform any edits needed (or don't for now) and then open up the Draftable Redlining feature by clicking the 3 dots in the top right of the toolbar:  
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-redline/image-2.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Then select the **Redline** in Draftable option:  
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-redline/image-3.png)  
        </Frame>
        
        <Note>
        **Note:**

        There are also options for *Compare attachments* and *1-Click Compare* options are included as workflow options in this Add-in.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Once selected, a new menu will appear for you on the right-hand side of the email editor. You will have an option to "Redline my changes" or "Accept and Reject changes".   
        
        Let's first go over how "Redline my changes" works. If you want to skip to learn to use "Accept or Reject changes", skip to step 7.   
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-redline/image-4.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Select "Redline my changes" to begin seeing the Redline compare with your existing changes already made in the email draft.   
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-redline/image-5.png)  
        </Frame>
        
        Here you also have the option to **Change Baseline** which allows you to select which baseline email is used for the Redlining of changes:  
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-redline/image-6.png)  
        </Frame>
        Simply select the email you wish to use as the Baseline and then continue with your workflow.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    As you make changes in the email editor, these will automatically appear in the Email Redline preview window. Once you are satisfied with your changes, select "Apply to Email" on the bottom right side of the Email Redline window. Your changes will apply as below to your email draft as redline:  
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-redline/image-7.png)  
        </Frame>
        **Alternatively.** you can hit the "Copy" button to copy the contents of this change and create a new email instead.   
        
        You can then send this redlined email to your intended recipient, and they will be able to view all the changes you made to that email.   
        
        If you want to review the changes of a draft email that another person has already Redlined using the above process, this is where we would want to use the "Accept or Reject changes" option instead.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Open an email that has redlined changes. Ensure you open your new email, hit reply and open the Draftable Redline feature as mentioned in steps 1-4 earlier.  
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-redline/image-8.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Select the "Accept or reject changes" option.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Once selected, the following window will appear. This window shows all the redlined changes that have been marked up by the sender of this email when they previously redlined the changes in their last email.   
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-redline/image-9.png)  
        </Frame>
        You can navigate through all the changes by selecting the **next** and **previous** buttons, and **Accept** or **Reject** changes as you review the redlined email.   
        
        <Note>
        **Note:** 
        
        If you **accidentally** accept or reject a change, you can hit CTRL+Z to undo it.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Continue accepting and rejecting changes until you are done, and then you are ready to reply, hit the **Create New Email** to create a new email with the accepted and rejected changes.   
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-redline/image-10.png)  
        </Frame>
        
        <Note>
        **Note:** 
        
        If you are using 'Compose' mode (editing/reply mode), there are cases where the Create New Email button does not appear as the changes are being made to your live reply.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    This will open a new email with all the accepted and rejected changes made.   
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-redline/image-11.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>
