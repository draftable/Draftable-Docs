## What is 1-Click Compare?

1-Click Compare gets you to your preferred next action in "1-Click". Users can launch a comparison of two files and generate their chosen 'next action' without any further steps. For example, you can use 1-Click Compare to go straight from selecting your files to:

- Creating an email with redline outputs and input files attached.
- Copying input files and comparison outputs to your clipboard .
- Immediately printing your preferred comparison output.
- Saving your your preferred comparison output to your DMS
- Opening your Redline in Word
