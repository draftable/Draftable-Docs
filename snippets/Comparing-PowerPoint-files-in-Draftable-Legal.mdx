Otherwise, Draftable Legal currently supports PowerPoint file comparisons via two approaches:

1. Redline PowerPoint comparison, viewed in PowerPoint
2. Redline PowerPoint comparison, viewed in Draftable
3. Using the Side-by-Side comparison type

This article shows you how to run both of these comparison types. Additionally, this article also include an explanation of the settings for Redline PowerPoint comparison that can be used to configure Redline comparisons.

## How to compare PowerPoint files in the Redline Comparison Type in PowerPoint

<Steps>
<Step>
Open the [Draftable Legal New Comparison window.](/hc/en-us/articles/19002140760217-Launching-a-Comparison-in-Draftable-Legal-A-Step-by-Step-Guide)  
	
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/using-draftable-comparing-powerpoint/image-1.png)
    </Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Select the two documents you want to compare, either by browsing your files or dragging and dropping them into the compare window.  

    <Frame>
    ![](/images/using-draftable-comparing-powerpoint/image-2.png)
    </Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Ensure you have selected the **Redline in PowerPoint** option for comparison type. Then, hit **Compare.**   
	
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/using-draftable-comparing-powerpoint/image-3.png)
    </Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
You will be asked whether you prefer to save the comparison as an export or open it directly in PowerPoint. For the sake of example, we will open this comparison directly into PowerPoint.   
	
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/using-draftable-comparing-powerpoint/image-4.png)
    </Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Your comparison will be opened in PowerPoint

    </Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Reviewing your comparison in PowerPoint

Viewing your Redline PowerPoint comparison in PowerPoint, you will note many different formatting elements. Lets take the slide below as an example:  

<Frame>
![](/images/using-draftable-comparing-powerpoint/image-6.png)
</Frame>

First, we can see 3 elements:

- Text that is highlighted in Red Strikethrough, to indicate this content has been deleted
- Text that is highlighted in Blue Underline, to indicate this content has been added 
- Text that remains unchanged, to indicate this content is the same between both documents. 

Additionally, in other slides, you will see some content appear in *greyscale*, this is to indicate that this content has also remained unchanged (this can be changed in the settings menu). See the example below:

<Frame>
![](/images/using-draftable-comparing-powerpoint/image-7.png)
</Frame>

Here we see text content that has remained unchanged and an image that also is consistent between both documents.

### Reviewing your Redline comparison in Draftable

Viewing your Redline PowerPoint comparison in Draftable, you will note many different elements. Lets take the slide below as an example:


<Frame>
![](/images/using-draftable-comparing-powerpoint/image-12.png)
</Frame>

First, we can see 3 components in this viewer:

- The slide selection screen on the left: Allowing you to navigate between all the slides  
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/using-draftable-comparing-powerpoint/image-13.png)
    </Frame>

- The slide preview screen in the middle: Where you can view your Redlined changes in the compared PowerPoint  
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/using-draftable-comparing-powerpoint/image-14.png)
    </Frame>

- Redline Changelist: Where you can easily view all the changes made within this comparison   
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/using-draftable-comparing-powerpoint/image-15.png)
    </Frame>

- Export and saving options: Export options are also available within the Draftable viewer for easy sharing of comparisons for your team to review. Select any of the relevant options if you wish to save or export your Redlined PowerPoint comparison for later viewing
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/using-draftable-comparing-powerpoint/image-16.png)
    </Frame>

Additionally, in other slides, you will see some content appear in *greyscale*, this is to indicate that this content has also remained unchanged (this can be changed in the settings menu). See the example below:

<Frame>
![](/images/using-draftable-comparing-powerpoint/image-17.png)
</Frame>

Here we see image content that has remained unchanged; however, there are text changes found on the left-hand side where the date has changed.

PowerPoint Redline comparisons can be configured in the settings menu to better suit your use case.
