## Registry Keys

All registry keys should be created under Computer\\HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Draftable\\Feature and should be of type REG\_SZ. If the key does not already exist, you can simply just create it. 

<Note>
**Please note:**

For system-wide configuration, it is highly recommended that you place the registry keys under Computer\\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Draftable\\Feature
</Note>

### Custom Compare Error Message

This registry key allows you to set a custom error message that will be shown when an error occurs.

```bash
Key: HKCU:\\Software\\Draftable\\Feature  
Value name: CustomCompareErrorMessage  
Value type: REG\_SZ  
Value data: <key>
```

For the value **&lt;key&gt;,** enter a string to change the text of the error message that is displayed for users.

### Custom Email Support Message

This registry key sets the response body of the email that users can send when prompted with an error.

```bash
Key: HKCU:\\Software\\Draftable\\Feature  
Value name: CustomEmailSupportMessage  
Value type: REG\_SZ  
Value data: <key>
```

For the value **&lt;key&gt;,** enter the desired email body string to change the body text of the default support email.

### Custom Error Contact Info Setting

This registry key sets the email address to which the support email will be sent when users are prompted with an error.

```bash

```bash
Key: HKCU:\\Software\\Draftable\\Compare  
Value name: NeverShareObfuscatedDocuments  
Value type: REG\_DWORD  
Value data: <key>
```

For the value **&lt;key&gt;**, this can be set to "1" for enabled, which means that obfuscated document submission is always disabled, or set the key to "0" disabled to ensure that documents sent via error messages are always obfuscated. 

### Users can share error logs

This registry key sets whether log files can be sent or not sent via email as part of a comparison error message.

```bash
Key: HKCU:\\Software\\Draftable\\Feature  
Value name: CompareErrorWindowAllowsToEmailLogs  
Value type: REG\_DWORD  
Value data: <key>
```

For the value **&lt;key&gt;**, this can be set to "1" for enabled, which means log files can be sent, or set the key to "0" disabled, which disables log files from being sent.

Ensure all configurations are correctly applied by restarting Draftable Legal or the user's computer if necessary. These settings will help streamline troubleshooting by providing custom error messages and facilitating smoother communication between the users and the support team.
