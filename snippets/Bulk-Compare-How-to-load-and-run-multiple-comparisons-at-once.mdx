<Note>
**Note:** 

This article was updated in January 2025 to reflect major changes to Bulk Compare's file loading interface and functionality in our [December 2024 release (v24.12.0)](/hc/en-us/articles/41369665084313-Release-Notes-Draftable-Legal-December-2024-v24-12-0)
</Note>

Bulk Compare allows users to **load multiple documents for comparison and run them simultaneously**. This 'Bulk Compare' feature is designed to save you time by removing the need to manually run every single comparison one by one.

Draftable's Bulk Compare allows up to 100s\* of comparisons to compare at once. Each comparison is run independently and users are then able to open each individually for review and to take next actions or to save all comparisons in one bulk action. 

*\*While there is no limit to the number of comparisons that can be run using the Bulk Compare feature, Draftable Legal only supports running up to 100 bulk compares at a time. Users can load and run more compares than this at their own discretion.*

## How to load files in Bulk Compare mode

File loading for Bulk Compare is designed to be intuitive and flexible. Individual files can be added either as Older or Newer documents, but once they are loaded can be easily rearranged however necessary to reflect the pairs and ordering needed.

Files can be loaded into Draftable when Bulk Compare mode is enabled via: 

- Local file browsing
- From your Document Management System (DMS)
- From recently compared files
- Via Drag and Drop.

### Loading via local file browsing

<Steps>
<Step>
Click the **Browse** folder icon (shown in the screenshot below) for either the **Older Document(s)** or **Newer Document(s).**  
	
    <Frame>
    ![Input file loading - browse local.png](/images//using-draftable-bulk-compare/image-4.png)
    </Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Draftable will open the windows file explorer menu, where you can select all documents required for bulk comparison and hit **Open** to add to Draftable. *Note, you are able to select multiple files at once by **holding 'Ctrl'** and clicking each individual file or by holding the '**Shift'** key and selecting the first and last files in the desired list.  
    
    <Frame>
    ![](/images//using-draftable-bulk-compare/image-5.png)
    </Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Once selected, the files will be added to either the 'Older Documents' or 'Newer Document(s) section based on the location where you opened the 'Browse menu. Draftable will automatically create spaces for potential pairings for each document. You can drag any of your loaded files to any other space in the arrangement.

    </Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Loading files from your Document Management System (DMS)

In Bulk Compare mode, you can load files from your Document Management System via the DMS icon inside Draftable or via your DMS application's file loading options. 

#### Load DMS files via the icon in Draftable

<Steps>
<Step>
Click the **DMS** cloud icon (shown in the screenshot below) for either the **Older Document(s)** or **Newer Document(s)**.

    </Frame>

    <Note>
	**Note:** 
    
    Draftable will automatically detect which DMS you have enabled and open the file selection menu. If you have multiple DMS integrations enabled, Draftable will choose the 'priority DMS' based on the following hierarchy: *iManage > NetDocuments > SharePoint > Epona. This means if you have iManage and SharePoint enabled, the DMS cloud icon will only open the iManage file selection menu.
