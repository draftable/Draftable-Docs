**Please note:** The Application installation and update can **take up to 72 hours (and in some cases longer)**. For more information about it, please visit Microsoft Documentation - [Deploy add-ins in the admin center - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide")  
</Note>
We recommend that if the Add-in hasn't been deployed in this time, you should get users to restart Outlook and their Machine to **prompt** the Add-in to be added.
