**Video Resource:** For a comprehensive understanding of Draftable group policy, we offer our specially crafted explainer video, accessible [via this link.](/hc/en-us/articles/27925463968793-Draftable-Legal-Enterprise-Configuration-with-Group-Policy-and-MS-Intune)

## What is Group Policy?

Group Policy is a feature in Microsoft Windows that provides centralized management and configuration of operating systems, applications, and users' settings in an Active Directory environment. This is particularly useful in enterprise settings, where maintaining uniform configurations across multiple machines is critical.

If you prefer to work directly with the windows registry and not use Group Policy, [here is an article](/hc/en-us/articles/24732245077401-Most-common-Draftable-Legal-registry-configurations) discussing all the registry key options you can set directly if that is your preferred configuration method.

## Obtaining the administrative templates

Group Policy is supported by Draftable irrespective of installation mechanism. The only difference between installation mechanism is where the administrative templates are installed to (and may need to be copied from into the administrative store). The administrative templates are found in the **GroupPolicy** folder under the product installation path.

For the Default MSI Installer the path will also contain a version number and the latest administrative templates will be in the folder with the latest version. Example path for Default Installer:

```bash
%LocalAppData%\DraftableDesktop\app-2.4.5500\GroupPolicy
```

For Machine-Wide MSI installations, the location of the Group Policy templates will typically default to:

```bash
C:\Program Files\Draftable Desktop
```

An easy way of determining the location of the Group Policy folder location is to right click the Draftable Legal application shortcut on the desktop, open properties and select ‘open file location’.”

Alternatively, you can always access the latest Group Policy templates from our knowledgebase article [here](/hc/en-us/articles/28666057117721-Draftable-Legal-Group-Policy-Template-Files).

## Installing the administrative templates

To install the templates, copy all files/folders in the **GroupPolicy** folder to the following location on the system(s) from which Group Policy will be managed:

```bash
C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions
```

You could perform the following alternate methods of installing administrative templates, by either:

- If your organization maintains a Central Store, copy the administrative templates to the  
	Central Store’s network path.
- Import custom and third party partner ADMX templates using [Microsoft Intune.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/administrative-templates-import-custom)

You will also need to copy the .adml files from the **GroupPolicy** folder in Draftable Desktop and paste these into the en-US folder within the **PolicyDefinitions** folder in C Drive:

```bash
C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\en-US
```

## Editing the policies in the Group Policy editor

Once the administrative templates are installed, the Draftable Pro policies can be found in Group  
Policy editor under:

- Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Draftable
- User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Draftable

Some settings may only be listed under one of the two scopes if they’re not supported on the other.

## Policy settings

These are the policy settings that can be set via Group Policy:

### Draftable Desktop group policy (affects both Desktop and Legal)
