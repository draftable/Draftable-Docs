## Printing Redline outputs 

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Start by opening the New Comparison window, selecting a Redline comparison as the comparison type. Choose your documents, and then hit **Compare**.  
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-printing-comparison/image-1.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    On the top ribbon menu of the comparison viewer, select the **Print** option. From here you can select the following options  
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-printing-comparison/image-2.png)  
        </Frame>
        - From here you can select from four options: 
            - **Redline (DOCX):** Print the comparison as a Redline output as a DOCX file
            - **Changed Pages Only:** This output shows only the changed pages between the older and newer documents. It marks up all changes in the changed pages as a Redline view
            - **Original file:** An copy of the older document
            - **Modified file:** An copy of the newer document
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click on the **Print export option** and you will be prompted to print your output and follow the printing dialog that appears.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Summary page 

The summary page option can be shown by selecting the **options** icon in the email output window.  
<Frame>
![](/images/using-draftable-printing-comparison/image-3.png)  
</Frame>
This allows you to add a summary page to the output and there are 3 options: 

- **Include at end:** Adds a summary page at the end of the output
- **Include at start:** Adds a summary page at the start of the output
- **Do not include:** Does not add a summary page

You can also choose to include a changes report as well, with the same options as above.
