description: "If you are seeing this article, it is likely you've run into an error when trying to use the Draftable App for SharePoint Online and have been asked to 'email logs' to Draftable Support. This article briefly explains what the emails logs button will do to help you determine whether you want to proceed with sharing the logs with our Support team."

## What's the issue?

Sometimes our Draftable App for SharePoint may fail to work as intended. This is often due to incorrect configuration (settings) due to fact that we were not able to anticipate your unique IT environment (e.g. interactions with other software, limitations for security reasons). These are often unique to your organization.  

## The solution

Clicking the 'email logs' button allows users to easily share a report of the error encountered with the Draftable support team. The tool does not share your documents with Draftable.

## How it works

- **What happens when I click the button?** The "Email Logs" button will automatically generate an email with as much of the extensions logs as possible within the email limitations.
- **How does it work?** It uses the "mailto: link" protocol.
- **Will it work with my default email?** The button should trigger a draft email in your default email handler on your windows system.
