***But first, a note from our product team***

Our product improvements are the direct result of insights from our customers. We are extremely grateful for the excellent feedback we received which allowed the June 2025 release to be possible.

If you have feature ideas or product performance feedback, we would love to hear from you. Please share any suggestions with us by contacting [product@draftable.com](mailto:product@draftable.com).

## Core Functionality

### Redline in Email: Accept / Reject changes in Outlook emails

From v25.6.100, reviewers can **action email feedback immediately** by Accepting or Rejecting individual redlined edits directly inside the 'Redline in Email' Outlook add-in, eliminating the need for time consuming manual edits.

From our v25.6.200 update, users can **catch more subtle formatting change in email threads** thanks to improvements in identifying style-only edits (e.g. numbered list changes) and previously invisible empty-paragraph changes.  

### Redline PowerPoint files using Draftable’s new PowerPoint Viewer

Users can now review redlined `.pptx` and `.ppt` files faster and more easily using Draftable’s new **PowerPoint viewer**. Changes are displayed with an interactive **clickable and filterable change list** to help users navigate between slide changes more easily. This allows faster review of presentation decks, pitch materials, and visual contracts.

## Accuracy and Quality

### Improved PDF detection for running OCR

**Our v25.6.100 update further enhanced OCR redlines on scanned PDFs** thanks to an updated Tungsten Automate configuration (powered by OmniPage) that improves PDF recognition and performance.

### Option to remove table-change layout bubbles in tracked changes

Lawyers and legal teams can now **export cleaner tracked-change documents** by enabling a new option (off by default and configured only by administrators) that automatically accepts table-layout changes, preventing empty revision balloons down the right-hand margin when printing to PDF.

## Markup Configuration

### Apply multiple text decorations to changes

From v25.6.100, teams can **apply clearer, more flexible markup** by combining multiple text decorations—such as bold **and** underline—in a single schema, making key changes impossible to miss. The new options are available in the Redline settings menu under 'markup schema'.

## Ease of use

### New option to refresh comparisons

Users can now **stay in flow when source files evolve**: a new **Refresh Comparison** command in Draftable's Comparison Viewer will rerun the comparison with any updated input files that have been synced to the user's DMS. This removes several clicks from rerunning comparison workflows and removes the need to context switch to the New Comparison Window.

### Switch profiles easily from the Comparison Viewer

Reviewers **trial different markup rules on the fly** by switching Redline Profiles from the Viewer ribbon—no need to rerun the comparison from scratch.

### New keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard-centric users **move through changes faster** with the default Ctrl + ← / Ctrl + → shortcuts to move between changes in the Comparison Viewer. Users are also provided with other keyboard shortcut options which can be adjusted in the Settings menu.

## Integration Functions

### 1-Click Compare attachments from Outlook

Draftable Legal’s **Outlook Add-In** now supports **1-Click Compare** for email attachments. This enhancement allows lawyers to immediately run redlines on incoming or outgoing files without needing to download and launch Draftable separately, streamlining inbox-based workflows.

### Support reloading locally saved files via the Word Add-In

The **Draftable Word Add-In** now supports the ability to load locally-saved changes made to files retrieved from either **iManage** or **NetDocuments**. When a user opens a DMS file and saves changes locally (i.e. without syncing changes to their DMS), Draftable will identify those locally saved changes and include them when loading via the Draftable Word Add-In. This removes the need to 'save and sync' changes back to a DMS to run a comparison, enabling more flexible comparison workflows across editing sessions.

## Administrator features

### Improved detection of MSI failures

IT teams can avoid stalled **roll outs** after performance tuning of the MSI installer to allow detection potential looped processes at start-up and prompt users with clearer recovery steps.
