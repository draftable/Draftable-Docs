### Configuring the setting via group policy

If you do not already have the Group Policy templates installed, please read this article first about the Draftable Legal [Group Policy Settings](/hc/en-us/articles/18763487262105-Configuring-settings-with-Group-Policy-Draftable-Legal) which details where the templates are located and how to install them.

Once you have installed the templates, you can open up the Group Policy Editor and expand either the Computer Configuration or User Configuration depending on how you are deploying Draftable Legal. Under the Administrative Templates folder, you will see a Draftable folder which contains three subfolders which that allow you to configure various Draftable Legal settings.

Here you can enable (to allow users to connect to iManage) or disable (prevent users from connecting to iManage) the setting. Once configured and saved, you can push out the setting to the relevant group of users.

This feature has been available since version 2.10 of Draftable Legal.
