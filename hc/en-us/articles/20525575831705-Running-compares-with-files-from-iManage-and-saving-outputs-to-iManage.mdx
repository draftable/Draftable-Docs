## Selecting a document from iManage to start a comparison

In the New Comparison window, click the **iManage** option.

	</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Navigate to your desired matter location and click on the document you wish to load. If you would like to load a specific **version** of a document, first click on the **"i"** located at the top right where it is highlighted in the image below. Otherwise, if you just want to load the document as is, simply ensure it is highlighted and click on **select** and skip to step 4.

You can select the "Save to DMS"  on the top ribbon in the comparison window. From here you have three options  
	  
	1. **Save to iManage (as a new file):** When saving to iManage, this will create a new document in an existing matter.
	  
	<Frame>
	![](/images/using-draftable-legal-with-iManage/image-159.png)
	</Frame>
	  
	2. **Save to iManage (as a new version):** When saving to iManage, this will create a new version of an existing document within iManage.  
	  
	<Frame>
	![](/images/using-draftable-legal-with-iManage/image-160.png)
	</Frame>
	  
	3. **Save to iManage (as a new related file):** When saving to iManage, this will create a new document within iManage but also create a link to an existing document within iManage.  
	  
	<Frame>
	![](/images/using-draftable-legal-with-iManage/image-161.png)
	</Frame>  
	  
	Additionally, you have the choice of 3 different file types outputs as well:  
    
	**Redline PDF or DOCX:** A Redline output is a document comparison output that highlights the differences between two documents using coloured markup, making it easy to identify added, removed, or modified content at a glance.  
	
    **Changed Pages Only (.pdf)** A Changed Pages Only Redline PDF is a document comparison output that only includes pages with differences between the two documents, highlighting the modifications using colored markup for a focused review of altered content.
   
    **Track Changes (.docx):** A Word document with Tracked Changes is a version of your document that displays all insertions, deletions, and formatting adjustments made, using Microsoft Word's built-in feature that allows you to review, accept, or reject the modifications individually.
</Step>
<Step>
If you selected **Save to iManage (as a new file)** An iManage window will appear for you to select the save location. Use the location of your choice and save the export
