The options you can choose from are as follows:

**Redline:** This saves a .pdf or .docx file where all changes are marked or "redlined" over the base document. This layout allows for easy visual comparison between the original and new versions of the document.

**Changed Pages Only:** This is similar to the Redline option, but it only includes pages where changes have occurred. This is a useful feature if you're dealing with lengthy documents and you want to focus just on the pages with modifications. You can only save this output as a .pdf file.

**Tracked Changes:** This saves into a .docx file with all updates embedded as 'Tracked Changes' in Microsoft Word. This is useful for further editing or reviewing in Word, as you can accept or reject changes individually and keep a record of who made what changes and when.

**Changes Report:** This saves a .csv or docx file with either all the changes from the comparison or if a filter has been used, just the changes that match the filter output.
</Step>
<Step>
Once you have chosen the output format you wish to save, click on the arrow (->) to bring up the DMSforLegal 'Save As' window. By default, this will open in the Epona location where the newer input file was selected from the New Comparison Window. If this is not where you wish to save the output, you can navigate through your Epona folders to the desired location to save the file, as well as edit the filename and create new folders.

## Saving directly to Epona (Track Changes in Word outputs)
