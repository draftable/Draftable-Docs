## What is the User Academy?

The Draftable Legal User Academy is your learning hub for mastering Draftable Legal and getting the most out of the product. Whether you're brand new to document comparison or you've already learned some of the fundamentals, this academy is your place to start or continue your learning journey.

<Note>
**Looking to train others?** If you're here to deliver training to your team or run train-the-trainer sessions, check out [Guidance for delivering training within your team](/hc/en-us/articles/Guidance-for-delivering-training-within-your-team) in the Training Centre — it's a better resource for delivering training from a human perspective rather than self-paced learning.
