This article provides troubleshooting steps for users encountering issues under two scenarios.

## Why Does This Happen?

These errors most commonly occur due to issues when Draftable is attempting to use Microsoft Word to complete document preprocessing steps (PDF conversion to Docx, or for Optical Character Recognition). The underlying cause of Word being unable to perform these tasks are:

- **Outdated Version**: Redlining functions best with the most recent versions of Microsoft Word. Older versions may cause conflicts.
- **Conflicting Settings:** Word has numerous settings that control its document handling. Sometimes, these settings can become jumbled and prevent Word from launching correctly.
- **PDF Conversion Issues**: Redlining often involves converting PDF files into Word documents. If this conversion process encounters problems, it can lead to Word crashing.

## The Solution: Troubleshooting Steps

### Check Office Version

Ensure that the application has correctly identified and set the Office version. Verify the Office install details below, ensuring it is Office 2016 or later (Version: 16.0.17126.20132, Arch: x64, Type: C2R).
<Steps>
<Step>
Open any Office application, such as Word or Excel, and select **Account**.
	<Note>
	  **Note:** If you don't see **Account** or you already have a file or document open, choose **File** from the menu, and then select either **Account** or **Help** from the list on the left.
	</Note>
</Step>
<Step>
Under **Product** **Information**, you'll find your Office product name and, in some cases, the full version number.

</Frame>

1 - **Product name**, such as Microsoft 365 ProPlus or Office Home and Student.

2 - **Version number**, which includes version, build number, and the type of installation such as Click-to-run or Windows Store.


*For more information, such as the bit-version, choose **About Excel**. A dialog box opens, showing the full version number and bit version (32-bit or 64-bit).*

	</Note>
</Step>
<Step>
Depending on your Office installation type (Click-to-run or MSI-based), you'll see the following options to proceed with the repair. Follow the steps for your installation type.   
	
    **Click-to-run** 

	In the window **How would you like to repair your Office** Programs, select **Online Repair** > **Repair** to make sure everything gets fixed. (The faster **Quick Repair** option is also available, but it only detects and then replaces corrupted files.)   
	<Frame>
	  <img src="/images/troubleshooting/image-26.png" alt="Install using click-to-run" />

	In the **Change your installation** window, select **Repair** and then click **Continue**.
</Step>
<Step>
Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the repair.

**After the Repair:**

- Try opening a document in Word or any other Office application and see if the issue is resolved.
