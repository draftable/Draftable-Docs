## New Features and Improvements

### Core Functionality

#### Improved accuracy and reliability on PDFs

Hot off the heels from our PDF improvements in the [September 2025 updates](/hc/en-us/articles/51126397213337-Release-Notes-Draftable-Legal-September-2025-v25-9-Series), lawyers can now enjoy **more reliable comparisons when using PDF input files**, thanks to the addition of the **Apryse conversion engine for PDF to DOCX pre-processing**. This addition means lawyers using Draftable will have access to the best-in-class PDF comparison quality allowing them to accurately interpret changes to PDF files. The update also ensured the Apryse engine is set as the default for all organizations regardless of previous administrator configuration.

#### Faster "Redline in Email" accept / reject workflows

Our October updates provided a new version of Draftable's "Redline in Email" Outlook add in ([v1.1.26](/hc/en-us/articles/46382047949977-Configuring-Redline-in-Email-Outlook-with-Draftable)). This update included:

- **A new** **Accept All / Reject All** option to allow reviewers to process email changes in bulk.
- **Enhanced baseline selection logic** to improve the accuracy of comparisons using “Compare against earlier email,” helping users avoid mismatched versions during redline creation.

These updates simplify review workflows for lawyers redlining correspondence and client communication.

### Integration Functions

#### Modern Microsoft Office add-in for file loading

Draftable now provides a **modern JavaScript (JS) add-in** for file loading from Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. This one modern Office add in lets users **quickly load files into Draftable** and removes the dependency on our existing VSTO COM add ins. The add-in can be deployed via the following manifest link:  
[https://dl.draftable.com/addins/office-simple/2.17.0.0/manifest.xml](https://dl.draftable.com/addins/office-simple/2.17.0.0/manifest.xml)The updated add-in works across desktop and web versions of MS Office, making it easier to integrate Draftable comparisons into day-to-day document workflows.

### Administrator Features

#### iManage tenant switching and configuration updates

For firms using on-premise iManage environments, Draftable now supports **easier switching between iManage tenants**. This is especially valuable for **global firms collaborating across multiple regions**. Updates include improvements to local configuration options and connection persistence between sessions.

Administrators can configure the multiple iManage server URLs for end users via Group Policy, ensuring lawyers aren't brought into technical configuration workflows.

#### Opt-in usage data reporting via organization-level telemetry tagging

Administrators can now choose to include an **organization-level GUID** in [telemetry data](/hc/en-us/articles/34620487450265-Product-Telemetry). This enables **tracking and reporting of Draftable usage** in customer organizations. Administrators can [opt-in to this system by adding the GUID via a registry setting change](/hc/en-us/articles/51788481256985-Configure-an-Organisation-Identifier-Group-Policy-Registry). Once enabled, requests can be made to [support@draftable.com](mailto:support@draftable.com) for usage data reports covering the following topics:

- The number of unique comparisons
- Monthly, weekly or daily active users,
- Comparison reliability (success rates),
- Comparison speed (i.e. pages per second)
- Input document formats compared (e.g. PDF, Word, Excel, PPT, etc)
- Comparison Types used (e.g. Redline in Draftable, Tracked Changes in Word, Side by Side, etc)
- Product versions in use (e.g. v25.10.0)
- Adoption / usage of specific features such as Redline in Email, bulk compare, one click compare, departures table, etc.

It’s important to note that Draftable **cannot report named users** as our system does not collect personally identifiable information (PII). In practice we can report the number of comparisons and usage frequency based on unique devices (i.e. computers) which we treat as a proxy for a unique ‘user’.

Draftable is in the process of implementing a federated named user identity management system alongside a new web-based administrative portal. This will provide automated reporting out of the box for your team and is expected to be ready by mid 2026 alongside the release of our web version of Draftable Legal.
