You can connect your NetDocuments account to Draftable Legal to load files from and save files to NetDocuments. In this article, we will guide you in connecting your NetDocuments account to Draftable Legal. You will need to have **ND Office** installed on your computer to use the Draftable Legal integration with NetDocuments. For more information on ND office, visit [https://support.netdocuments.com/s/article/205220000](https://support.netdocuments.com/s/article/205220000)

<Note>
**Please note:** This workflow is required to use the NetDocuments integration (i.e. loading files from NetDocuments, saving to NetDocuments). To use this integration, you will also need to have your system administrator set up the integration with your NetDocuments cabinet ([see here](/hc/en-us/articles/25960764447385-Set-up-guide-for-Draftable-Legal-integration-with-Netdocuments)).
