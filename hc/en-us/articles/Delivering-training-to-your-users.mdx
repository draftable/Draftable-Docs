## Option 1: Self-Service Approach

**Best for:** Organizations that prefer minimal training overhead and have users who are comfortable learning independently.

### How it works

In this approach, you direct users to our existing learning resources and let them self-serve their own learning journey. As the training manager, you act as a point of contact for questions and assistance when users encounter things they don't understand.

### Your role as training manager

- **Introduce Draftable Legal** — Let users know Draftable is available and where to find learning resources
- **Share the starting point** — Direct users to [How to use this academy](/hc/en-us/articles/How-to-use-this-academy)
- **Be available for questions** — Act as a support resource when users need clarification
- **Monitor adoption** — Check in periodically to ensure users are progressing

### Resources to share with users

<Steps>
<Step title="Draftable Legal User Academy">
The primary self-service learning resource with step-by-step guides and structured learning paths.

<a href="/hc/en-us/articles/How-to-use-this-academy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  **→ Share this link with your users**
</a>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro tip:** Send an introductory email pointing users to the User Academy, and let them know you're available if they have questions. This sets expectations while keeping your workload minimal.
</Tip>

## Option 2: Hybrid Approach

**Best for:** Organizations that want structured guidance while still leveraging self-service resources.

### How it works

In this approach, you provide users with access to both the Draftable Legal User Academy and the Training Centre & Video Resources. As the training manager, you are expected to understand Draftable Legal to a high competency level. You may deliver certain training sessions yourself in addition to directing users to self-serve for other topics.

### Your role as training manager

- **Master the product** — Work through all resources yourself to achieve high competency
- **Deliver key sessions** — Run focused training sessions on critical workflows or complex features
- **Curate learning paths** — Guide users on which resources to use and in what order
- **Supplement with Q&A** — Host follow-up sessions to answer questions and reinforce learning

### Resources to share with users

<Steps>
<Step title="Draftable Legal User Academy">
Written guides and structured learning paths for self-paced learning.

### Suggested hybrid training structure

| Delivery Method | Topics | Who Delivers |
|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| **Live session** | Introduction to Draftable, core redline workflows | You (training manager) |
| **Self-service** | Comparison types, Excel/PowerPoint comparisons | Users via User Academy |
| **Live session** | Advanced workflows (1-Click, Bulk Compare) | You (training manager) |
| **Q&A session** | Open questions, real-world scenarios | You (training manager) |

## Option 3: In-House Only Approach

**Best for:** Organizations that prefer complete control over training content and delivery, or have specific compliance/documentation requirements.

### How it works

In this approach, you don't direct users to the Draftable Legal User Academy or Training Centre at all. Instead, you learn everything yourself, create your own custom training materials, and deliver all training in-house. You may cherry-pick references or resources from the Draftable knowledge base to fill in gaps for your users when needed.

### Your role as training manager

- **Become the expert** — Work through the entire User Academy and Training Centre & Video Resources to master all features
- **Engage with support** — Contact [support@draftable.com](mailto:support@draftable.com) for additional information or clarification on advanced topics
- **Create custom materials** — Build your own training guide, slides, or documentation tailored to your organization's workflows
- **Deliver all training** — Run all training sessions yourself using your custom materials
- **Provide ongoing support** — Be the go-to resource for all Draftable questions within your organization

### Resources for your own learning
