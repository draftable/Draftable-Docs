Rolling out Draftable Legal to your team? This guide provides resources and best practices for delivering effective training.

## Training resources available

### Video tutorials

We have a library of training videos in the [Training Centre & Video Resources](/hc/en-us/articles/27925634630937-Draftable-Legal-High-Level-Overview) section covering:

- High-level product overviews
- Feature-specific demonstrations
- DMS integration walkthroughs

### Written guides

The User Academy provides step-by-step written guides that users can follow at their own pace. Point your team to [How to use this academy](/hc/en-us/articles/How-to-use-this-academy) as a starting point.

## Training delivery tips

<Tip>
**Keep sessions focused** - Rather than trying to cover everything at once, focus on the features your team will use most frequently.
</Tip>

### Suggested training structure

| Session | Duration | Topics |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Session 1: Getting Started** | 30 mins | Basic comparisons, redlines, side-by-side view |
| **Session 2: Workflows** | 30 mins | 1-Click Compare, Bulk Compare, saving outputs |

### Best practices
