Welcome to the **Training Centre & Video Resources**, your destination for hands-on, video-based training content for Draftable Legal, as well as training management information and supplementary resources.

<Warning>
**Stop! Are you an individual user looking to learn Draftable Legal?**

If you're here to learn Draftable Legal for yourself through structured, self-paced learning, **this section isn't your best starting point**.

We recommend starting with the [Draftable Legal User Academy](/hc/en-us/articles/How-to-use-this-academy) instead. It provides comprehensive written guides and step-by-step learning paths designed for individual users.

This Training Centre is an **alternative and supplementary resource**, particularly useful if you prefer learning through video content or if you're responsible for training others.
