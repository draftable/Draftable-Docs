<Warning>
**New to Redline profiles and settings?** If you don't yet understand Redline profiles or Redline settings in Draftable Legal, we highly recommend reading the [Redline Comparison Settings](/hc/en-us/articles/16549612535705-Redline-comparison-settings) article first. Alternatively, perform pilot testing with Draftable to understand what the settings do before rolling this out. Once you and your team have decided what profiles you want to deliver to your users, come back to this article to proceed with deployment.
</Warning>

For administrators looking to configure profiles for end users, please see [Configuring Redline profiles within Group Policy](/hc/en-us/articles/22665341687705-Configuring-Redline-profiles-within-Group-Policy)

## Configuring Redline settings Profiles

Below are all the different methods for creating, importing, exporting, renaming and deleting profiles from within the Redline settings section. 

### Creating a profile

Within the Redline Comparison section, make all the changes you require to all the different settings for your Redline comparisons. Once you have completed doing so, go to the top of the **Redline** section, select **Add profile.****
