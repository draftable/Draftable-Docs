title: "Creating your custom deployment guide"
description: "A high-level overview guide that directs administrators through the complete deployment process for Draftable Legal, from initial setup to final configuration."
---

This guide provides a comprehensive, high-level overview of the entire Draftable Legal deployment process. It is designed to help IT administrators and deployment teams ensure they complete every necessary step in the correct order.

## Before you begin

<Warning>
**Order matters!** The Administrator Deployment Track is ordered in a very deliberate manner. While you can skip components that aren't relevant to your installation, **you cannot do them in a different order**. Steps must be completed in the sequence they appear. Following the correct order ensures dependencies are met and avoids configuration issues.
</Warning>

### How to use this guide

Every article in this guide is hyperlinked to open in a new tab. We recommend the following approach:

<Steps>
<Step title="Click the article link">
Each article link opens in a new tab so you don't lose your place in this guide.

## Section 1: Getting Install Ready

This section covers the **bare minimum requirements** for deployment. It details the entry-level components you need to understand and configure before installing Draftable Legal on user machines.

### System and network requirements

Ensure all end-user machines and your network meet the requirements for Draftable Legal. Review this article to identify any potential issues before deployment begins.

### Enterprise deployment options

This article explains the different installer types available and provides recommendations for each deployment scenario.

<Tip>
**Deploying to multiple users?** If you're doing a group-wide deployment (typically more than 10 users), using the **Machine-Wide MSI installer** is generally recommended for this entire deployment track. You can use the default installer, but that requires running the installation on each machine individually.
</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step title="Enterprise deployment options" icon="check">
Understand the available installer types and choose the right one for your deployment.

### Configuring settings with Group Policy

This article details **every Group Policy option** available for Draftable Legal. Some options may not be immediately useful, as they only become relevant after piloting the product (such as Redline Profiles, explained later in this guide). However, there are several key settings you should review carefully.

**Key Group Policy settings to note:**
- **Product Key Activation** — Your license key can be deployed via Group Policy, eliminating the need for users to enter it manually
- **Usage statistics configuration** — Control telemetry and usage data collection
- **DMS selections** — Pre-configure Document Management System settings

<Note>
**Important:** The Product Key can be added as part of Group Policy configuration. This article explains all Group Policy options currently available for Draftable Legal. Read through this section carefully.
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Configuring settings with Group Policy - Draftable Legal" icon="check">
Review and configure Group Policy settings for your deployment.

### Group Policy Template Files

This article provides the **ADMX and ADML template files** required for Group Policy configuration. These files are useful if you're deploying with pre-configured settings that you want to push to all users.

<Steps>
<Step title="Draftable Legal Group Policy Template Files" icon="check">
Download and install the Group Policy template files.

### Deployment options via MSI (System-wide) installer

This is typically the **last article you complete in this section** before actually deploying Draftable Legal. It provides default MSI switches, recommendations, and features that can be installed using the MSI.

<Warning>
**Read carefully before deploying!** Most administrators will be using an MSI-type installation, whether via Command Line or Intune. It is critical that you read through this article thoroughly and understand the options before beginning your deployment.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step title="Deployment options via MSI (System-wide) installer" icon="check">

## Section 2: Post Installation Configurations

<Warning>
**Post-installation only!** This section can only be completed **after Draftable Legal has been installed** on user machines. We recommend completing all the steps in Section 1 and deploying Draftable before proceeding with this section.
</Warning>

While some of these configurations can technically be done before or after Draftable has been installed, it is generally recommended for easier deployment that they are all completed after the product has been deployed.

### Setting up your DMS to Draftable Legal

This article is essentially its **own miniature guide** for configuring Document Management System integrations. If you have DMSs you want to integrate with Draftable Legal (whether multiple systems or just one), we recommend reading through this section thoroughly and following the procedures correctly.

<Note>
**No DMS?** If you are not configuring any DMS integrations, you can skip this article entirely.
</Note>

## Section 3: Installation of Advanced Draftable Workflows

## Section 4: End-User Application Configuration

<Tip>
**Best completed after pilot testing.** The configurations in this section are best done **after some users have had the opportunity to pilot Draftable Legal**. Users need hands-on experience with the product to understand what settings and profiles work best for their workflows. Consider completing this section after your team has used Draftable for a while and identified their preferred configurations.
</Tip>

This section covers pre-configuring application settings that will be applied to end users, such as Redline profiles and default workflows.
