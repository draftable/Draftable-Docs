## Customizing and using comparisons

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I customize my comparisons?">

Depending on the administrative settings of your organization, as an individual user, you may or may not be permitted to adjust the rendering settings of your comparison output. In the case where comparison customization is available to you, follow the below steps to customize your comparisons.

Open the settings menu in the Draftable launcher (top right corner).

<Frame>
![](/images/frequently-asked-questions/image-42.png)
</Frame>



Navigate to the Redline tab for Redline comparison settings.

<Accordion title="Can I create Redline profiles / rendering sets?">

Depending on the administrative settings of your organization, as an individual user, you may or may not be permitted to create your own Redline profiles (rendering sets) in addition to the ones set by your organization.

Redline profiles allow you to load in a preset of Redline settings for your Draftable legal application to easily apply different setting profiles depending on the documents you are comparing at the time. Profiles and configuring profiles is an involved process and we recommend you read [our dedicated knowledge base article](/hc/en-us/articles/19002240548249-Managing-profiles-for-Redline-settings) if you wish to learn more.

<Accordion title="How do I rename comparison outputs?">

To customize your default comparison output naming convention, go to 'Settings' - Choose 'Redline' (vertical ribbon on the left-hand side) and scroll down to 'Filename output'. You would be able to set up your preferred filename convention by selecting one of the preset options from the drop-down menu or setting up your own convention.

<Accordion title="How do I generate Changed pages only output?">

Changed pages output is available for **Redline in Draftable** comparison output - you can review the document in the mode where only changed pages are shown, as well as export this output as a PDF changed pages-only file.

<Steps>
<Step>
In the 'Comparison type' in the Draftable launcher (New comparison window), select Redline in Draftable and click 'click' the 'Compare' button;
</Step>
<Step>
Once the comparison is ready, in the Draftable viewer, to enable the interactive changed pages view feature whilst viewing your comparison, click the icon shown below (at the top of the screen).

<Accordion title="What comparison output is available for Word/PDF file comparisons?">

For your Word-Word, PDF-PDF or Word-PDF comparisons, you have the following comparison output options available: PDF redline, Word with tracked changes and Side-by-side.

Below you can see explanations of what each of these outputs is and why you might prefer one output versus the other for certain workflows.

**Redline in Draftable:**

- The comparison will be opened within the Draftable PDF viewer;
- This option is great when you want to quickly review the comparison in a clean PDF-style format and proceed with your next actions from there;
- From the next actions panel on the right-hand side in the viewer you will be able to select whether you want to export your comparison in any format (PDF, PDF changed pages only, Word with tracked changes);
- You can email your comparison output directly from the viewer in a 'single click';
- You can also switch to Word with tracked changes output directly from the viewer without having to re-run the comparison (just click 'Open' in the menu panel within the viewer, and select: 'Word with Track Changes').

**Tracked Changes in Word:**

- The comparison will be saved directly in Word with changes shown in tracked changes;
- This output format will allow you to continue working with the markup in the familiar Word environment, so you would be able to further modify the document, accept/reject tracked changes, etc.

**Side-by-side:**

- The comparison will open in the Draftable side-by-side viewer, where both (original and modified) documents are displayed side-by-side, and the changes are shown in highlight in those documents;
- Given that this output format shows you the changes in the context of both input files, it is useful for comparing documents with a large volume of changes, where a standard redline format could be hard to read and understand.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I compare scanned documents in PDF format?">

Yes, you can! Just upload the PDF file for comparison (without needing to convert it into another format first). Draftable Legal has built-in OCR capabilities, which will allow your document to be compared straightaway.

To enable OCR, go to the 'Settings' menu and navigate to the 'General' tab. In the 'Scanned documents' section, enable OCR by selecting 'Automatic' or 'Always' in the drop-down menu.

<Frame>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I switch to Word with Tracked Changes without re-running the comparison?">

Where you have performed your Word/PDF/text comparisons in Redline in Draftable format, the comparison will open in the Draftable viewer.

However, if you wish to switch to Word with Tracked Changes, you can do so directly from the Draftable viewer without needing to re-run the comparison.

To do so:

- Navigate to 'Open' in the next actions ribbon on the top of the viewer.
- Select 'Track Changes' and the comparison will open in MS Word as Track Changes document.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why use the Draftable viewer?">

The Draftable viewer offers a lot of functionality that does not exist in typical output formats (such as a PDF viewer), which enhances the comparison functionality and use.

**Redline comparison features include:**

Next actions panel for a streamlined workflow:

- Allows you to easily save, share and print your comparison;
- If you want to email your comparison - you can do so directly from the Draftable viewer, you would be able to generate a new email and include all relevant comparison outputs (as well as input files), or you can copy files to your clipboard and paste them to your existing email.

Use the Changed Pages Only view to save precious time in review:

- Allows you to only view the pages that were changed;
- This feature is available in its interactive format from the viewer or as an export (PDF Changed pages).

Customized comparison output - a tidy comparison that is easy to read:

- View comparison in the way that makes it easy for you - through markup customization options, individual users or organizations at the administrative level can set up Profiles / rendering sets to personalize the comparison output to match individual/organizational preferences;
- These settings are controlled via [the Draftable settings.](https://help.draftable.com/hc/en-us/articles/29932364732569#h_01HS7B18FPZ4NAVJXG40RCWPX1)

**Side-by-side comparison features include:**

- Change list: This allows you to easily see all the changes shown in a comparison. The change list can also be exported;
- Synced scrolling: Retains both the 'base' and 'modified' documents in alignment, such that the changes are easy to understand in the context of each document as you scroll through the documents;
- Ability to tag & annotate changes: you can tag changes to assign priority and indicate where further action is required, as well as annotate changes by including custom entry "notes".

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I run PowerPoint and Excel comparisons?">

With Draftable Legal, you can compare PowerPoint to PowerPoint files and Excel to Excel files.

<Frame>
![](/images/frequently-asked-questions/image-53.png)
</Frame>


</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What comparison outputs are available for PowerPoint and Excel comparisons?">

After adding files in the Draftable launcher, you will need to select the type of comparison you wish to receive from the 'Comparison type' drop-down menu.

For PowerPoint and Excel comparisons, output types are available in native (PowerPoint tracked changes / Spreadsheet compare) format or in a side-by-side view.

**PowerPoint files:**

- **Redline Tracked Changes**: The comparison will be opened as a PowerPoint file with all modifications to the document displayed as tracked changes, such that you would be able to navigate through the changes and 'accept' / 'reject' them; or
- **Side by side**: This will open the comparison output in Draftable side-by-side view, where both documents are visible on the screen at the same time and all changes are highlighted.

**Excel files:**

- **Redline Tracked Changes**: This dedicated format visualizes changes directly within spreadsheet of the Excel file via Spreadsheet compare; or
- **Side-by-side**: This will open the comparison output in a Draftable side-by-side view, where both documents are visible on the screen at the same time and all changes are highlighted.

<Accordion title="A comparison I tried failed to work, what do I do now?">

If you attempt to run a comparison and it fails to work, we recommend the following steps to self-diagnose the issue to hopefully assist you in successfully completing that comparison:

- If you were comparing one or two Word files, try re-saving the document into PDF format using Microsoft Word, and then attempt a comparison;
- Restart Draftable and then retry running the comparison.

If these fail, get in touch with either your dedicated support team or our support team at [support@draftable.com](mailto:support@draftable.com).

<Accordion title="How can I share my documents with Support without sharing confidential information?">

Where your comparison failed or certain changes within the compared document were not displayed appropriately, in order to diagnose the issue, we often require the relevant input files. However, we are mindful that confidentiality concerns would typically prevent you from sharing the documents with us due to the sensitive information.

The 'File Obfuscator' feature within Draftable Legal is there to address this matter. This function will allow you to completely anonymize the content of your files, such that we (or anyone) would be able to de-cypher it. The obfuscated files would still retain relevant elements of the documents, such that we would be able to analyze what is causing an issue without having access to the actual content of the original files.

To access this feature, go to 'Settings', under 'Troubleshooting' select 'File Obfuscator'. This will open a new window wherein you can choose relevant documents for anonymization. Once an obfuscated file is created, you will be able to send it on to the support team for further diagnosis.

To learn more about this feature in order to use it, go to [this article in our knowledge base](/hc/en-us/articles/22361579075225-Explainer-Using-the-Obfuscator-feature-to-share-redacted-documents-with-Draftable-Support).
