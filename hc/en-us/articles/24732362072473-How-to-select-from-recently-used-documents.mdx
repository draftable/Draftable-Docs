## Selecting recently used documents for comparison

Ensure you have the New Comparison window open. If you look at the comparison selection boxes you will note there is now a new option in the top right corner called **Recent** which is a drop down box selection button.

**Selecting** this option will provide a drop down list of all the recent documents you have used to compare and provides time information of how long ago you used that document.

Selecting the documents from this list will automatically load them into the selection boxes without the need of having to find these documents again.
