## License Activation

To activate the instance, the product license is verified by our license servers.

| Host | Port | Protocol | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| draftable.com | 443 | HTTPS | Yes |

<Note>
The IP address may change due to CDN and load balancer usage, so the firewall should dynamically whitelist based on the DNS query response.
