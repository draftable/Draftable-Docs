## Features and Improvements

### Core Functionality

#### Departures Table Enhancements

All users of Draftable Legal can now automatically generate a table formatted output document showing with all changes with the relevant clause number referenced, and Microsoft word comments from input files and any tags or notes added in Draftable shown in a 'Review Notes' column. Based on feedback from customers testing the preview version of this feature, the February release included the following improvements:

- Better output formatting for readability.
- A new option in the 'next actions' menu of the Draftable viewer to export the Departures Table directly into the email body, with or without the change list filtering applied (pictured).

- Added ability to extract inline comments within the Departures Table into the 'Review Notes' column (pictured).

#### Excel Redline Improvements

Based on further feedback from customers since January's release of our Excel Redline viewer in Draftable, we have made improvements to this workflow to ensure better legibility of formula changes in the viewer and provide more information in the changes report. 

Below is an example of our improvement for enhanced legibility for the Excel Viewer when formula change borders are displayed.

### Accuracy and Quality Enhancements

#### Improved comparison of text boxes

The February 2025 update allows users who compare documents with text boxes to see higher quality outputs thanks to improvements to our Text Box comparisons algorithm. This improvement has removed the likelihood of Draftable displaying false changes (i.e. showing unchanged text boxes as insertions and deletions) due to small movements in the location of the text box, and ensures that revised inserted text in text box is displayed in a way that is easy to read.

#### Improved quality of Redline in PowerPoint

We have also released an enhanced PowerPoint Redline algorithm that reduces the for more accurate slide comparisons. Specifically, these improvements have optimized our comparison algorithm to:

- Ensure moved text boxes are clearly displayed as a move
- Missing markup for inserted shapes
- Optimize text size to avoid redlined text running outside of the slide

### Markup Configuration Updates

#### New Markup Schema option to use highlights to display changes

Law firms and legal teams working with vision impaired clients or staff often have trouble ensuring changes can be easily seen and understood by those audiences. Based on feedback from users, our February release includes a new option in the Redline Profile settings to use highlights to indicate changes.

#### Ignore footnote changes in Changed Pages Only output

We heard from many law firms that their Document Management System often inserts the Document ID and version number into the footer of their documents. This meant each version had a footer change on every page, and while lawyers do want to see those changes redlined, footer changes should on their own be enough to include a page in the 'Changed Pages Only' PDF output. 

In our February release, we have implemented a new Redline profile setting (set to off by default) that ensures if the only change on a page is either in the header or footer, these changes will be ignored in the 'Changed Pages Only' PDF export.

Importantly, the 'Changed Pages Only' output will still show redlined changes in the header and footer for pages that are included.

### Ease of Use Enhancements

Several law firms provided feedback to Draftable that their users would prefer to see the changes summary statistics (e.g. number of insertions, deletions, etc) at the top of the Draftable Viewer. The February update of Draftable Legal has added a new collapsible section to our Comparison Viewer which displays these summary statistics at the top of the screen.
<Frame>
![Summary statistics in viewer.png](/images/draftable-legal/image-83.png)
</Frame>
Users and administrators can configure how this is displayed via the General tab in the Settings menu or via the Windows Registry or Group Policy, choosing from the following options:

- Do not display the statistics section
- Display the statistics section collapsed by default
- Display the statistics section shown by default

#### Automatically use the latest two versions for 1-Click Compare

When using 1-Click Compare commands in document management systems, users previously were asked to first select the two versions for comparison from a list. We have now updated the '1-Click Compare' logic to leverage the setting available in the Integrations tab of the Settings menu, which enables users to have Draftable automatically select the two most recent versions of a file when using 1-Click Compare.

To enable this behavior, users or administrators just need to ensure the integration setting 'Enable automatic selection of the two latest versions' is checked.

#### Updated HTTP Listener Service for new Outlook Add-In 

Our February update also updated our HTTP Listener Service to prepare this for the upcoming release of our new Outlook Add-In which will include functionality for redlining changes in emails.
