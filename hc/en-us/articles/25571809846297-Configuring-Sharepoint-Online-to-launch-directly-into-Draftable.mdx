The Draftable App for SharePoint Online requires access to both Draftable Legal and an **administrator-level account for configuring Draftable within** your **SharePoint Admin Center**.

<Note>
Note, once the Draftable App for SharePoint is enabled, API access for the following needs to be approved:

- Microsoft Graph, Directory.Read.All
- Microsoft Graph, Files.Read.All
- Microsoft Graph, User.Read

This is covered in the second section of this guide.
