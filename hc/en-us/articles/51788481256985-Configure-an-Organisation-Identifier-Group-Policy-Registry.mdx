The **Configure an Organisation Identifier** policy setting allows organizations to include a unique identifier with all telemetry data sent from Draftable Legal.


## Overview

The **Configure an Organisation Identifier** setting lets administrators specify a unique **organization identifier (GUID)** that will be included in all telemetry events generated by Draftable Legal.

This identifier enables Draftable to associate telemetry data with your organization for reporting and analysis purposes.

No user-level **personally identifiable information (PII)** is collected or transmitted.

This policy is particularly useful for enterprise environments that require audit and reporting controls or where telemetry data is analyzed centrally.


## Group Policy Configuration

Once the latest Draftable Legal administrative templates have been installed (pulled from Draftable Legal v25.9.000), the policy can be found under:

```bash
User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Draftable > Feature
```

Policy Name: **Configure an Organisation Identifier**

When enabled, this setting allows you to enter a **string identifier** that represents your organization.  
The value entered here will be included in all telemetry events from Draftable Legal installations under this policy.

**Policy options:**

- **Not Configured / Disabled** – No organization identifier will be included in telemetry events.
- **Enabled** – Enter your organization's identifier string (GUID or text label) in the provided field.

## Registry Configuration

This policy can also be configured directly in the Windows Registry if Group Policy is not used.

**Registry path:**

```bash
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Draftable\Feature
```

**Key name:** `OrganizationIdentifier`  
**Key type:** `REG_SZ`  
**Key value:** **(Your organization name or GUID)**

For example:

```bash
"OrganizationIdentifier"="ContosoLegalTeam"
```

Additionally, this can be placed in the machine-wide level path, which would be:

```bash
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Draftable\Feature
```


## Notes

- This policy only affects telemetry data used for diagnostic and product improvement purposes.
- Draftable does **not** collect or transmit any user-level personally identifiable information (PII).
- The identifier is for organizational grouping only and will not affect product functionality or licensing.
