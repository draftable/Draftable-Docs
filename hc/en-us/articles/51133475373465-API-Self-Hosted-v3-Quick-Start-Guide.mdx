## Initial Deployment

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare your directory">
	On your Linux server, create a dedicated folder that contains your `.ENV` file and the Docker Compose file. Adjust the settings in the `.ENV` file to suit your use case.

    <Note>
	**Note:** You can pre-configure your product key in the `.ENV` file.  
	Example:
	```bash
	DRAFTABLE_PRODUCT_KEY=XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
	```
    </Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Navigate to the directory and deploy the container">
	First ensure you are currently operating within the directory where the compose file and .ENV exists. 
	```bash
	cd /location_of_your_directory
	```
	Run the following command from inside your deployment folder:
	```bash
	docker compose up
	```
</Step>
<Step title="Note">
Add the `-d` flag if you want to run the container in the background:
	```bash
	docker compose up -d
	```
</Step>
<Step title="Access the UI">
	Open your browser and navigate to the HTTPS address you configured in your `.ENV` and Compose files.  
	  
	Example:
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/image-2.png)
    </Frame>

</Step>
<Step title="Set up the Administrator account">
	On first launch, you will be prompted to create an Administrator account.

    ![](/images/image-3.png)
    </Frame>
    <br />
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/image-4.png)
    </Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Log in as Administrator">
	After creating your account, log in with the Administrator credentials.   
	  
	<Frame>
    ![](/images/image-5.png)
    </Frame>
    <br />
	You now have full UI access to the container.  
	 
	<Frame>
    ![](/images/image-6.png)
    </Frame>

</Step>
<Step title="Retrieve your API credentials">
	Navigate to **Account Settings** within the Administrator portal to view your API credentials.   
	  
	<Frame>
    ![](/images/image-7.png)
    </Frame>
	  
	With these credentials, you can now start using the API.  
	<Frame>
    ![](/images/image-8.png)
    </Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="Manage users and settings">
	Use the Administrator portal to modify user accounts, update settings, and manage your deployment. Selecting the **Account settings** of the user you wish to configure will open the Django administration page.  
	  
	<Frame>
    ![](/images/image-9.png)
    </Frame>
	  
	Here you can configure the settings for the user account. These settings impact things like file size limitations, UI configuration and default values with comparison UI.
