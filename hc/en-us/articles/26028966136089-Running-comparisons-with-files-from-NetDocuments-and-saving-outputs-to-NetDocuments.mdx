## Saving comparison outputs to NetDocuments

<Frame>

</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Once the comparison is ready, the **Comparison Viewer** will appear.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Note that all the export options appear in the top ribbon menu above the comparison viewer.
</Step>
<Step>
There are two main options for outputs saved to **NetDocuments.** You can either Save to **Netdocuments** or Save to **NetDocuments (as attachment)**.

Regardless both options come with the same output options, however, you can specifically save a document as an attachment if required using the "Save to NetDocuments (as attachment)" option.

</Step>
<Step>
You can select from one of the below options:

**Redline:** This saves into a .pdf or .docx file where all changes are marked or "redlined" over the base document. This layout allows for easy visual comparison between the original and new versions of the document.

**Changed Pages Only:** This is similar to the Redline option, but it only includes pages where changes have occurred. This is a useful feature if you're dealing with lengthy documents and you want to focus just on the pages with modifications. Can only be saved as a .PDF.

**Tracked Changes:** This saves into a .docx file with all updates embedded as 'Tracked Changes' in Microsoft Word. This is useful for further editing or reviewing in Word, as you can accept or reject changes individually and keep a record of who made what changes and when.

**Changes Report:** This will save a summary of the document changes found within the Redline. You can pick to either save this in a DOCX or a CSV file format and show all the Reported changes, or just those Matching the filters you have set in the Change List panel.

Also, if you click on the **"Options'** link at the top of the Comparison Results pop up window, you will also see three additional choices.

</Frame>

**Summary page:** Includes a brief summary of the number of changes made, as well at the Markup Schema used for the Redline.

**Changes report:** Includes the full changes report either at the start of the document or at the end.

**Reported changes:** Allows change report to either include or the changes in the comparison or just those that you displayed via the filter options.

After selecting your preferred output option, a NetDocuments **'Save As' window** will now appear. From here you have the option to edit the file metadata, as well as specify the save type:
</Step>
<Step>
a) **Save to NetDocs (as a new file):** When saving to NetDocs, this will create a new document in an existing matter. If you wish to save as a new file, simply progress to **step 6.**

b) **Save to NetDocs (as a new version):** When saving to NetDocs, this will create a new version of an existing document within NetDocs. If you wish to save as a new version, select the **'Save as new version'** checkbox.
