## Installer for enterprise deployments

For deployments in enterprise environments, the default installer for Draftable Business may not be suitable. Draftable Business offers an alternative installer: a machine-wide MSI installer.

Each installer has trade-offs, different recommended deployment scenarios, advantages, and installation steps.

### Default Installer

**Installer Type:** Regular executable (.exe)

**Installer Scope:** Per-user

**Requires Admin:** No

**Recommended scenarios:** Individual users, small-scale deployments

**Download URL:** [https://dl.draftable.com/desktop/DraftableDesktopSetup.exe](https://dl.draftable.com/desktop/DraftableDesktopSetup.exe)

This installer is recommended for most scenarios and is the default installer provided. It's the easiest to use and has minimal requirements - ideal for individual users.

#### Benefits

- No administrator privileges are required for installation
- Updates are automatically applied

#### Notes

- Each user on the system needs to run the installer (per-user deployment)
- Each user maintains their own copy of the product

#### Installation

1. Run the installer
2. Follow the prompts, which will include selecting the install location and entering the product key
3. Draftable Business is installed and ready to use

### Machine-Wide MSI

**Also Known As:** Native MSI, Per-Machine MSI

**Installer Type:** MSI (Windows Installer)

**Installer Scope:** System

**Requires Admin:** Yes 

**Recommended scenarios:** Citrix & Remote Desktop Services deployments, high-security environments 

**Download URL:** [https://dl.draftable.com/desktop/DraftableDesktopSystem.msi](https://dl.draftable.com/desktop/DraftableDesktopSystem.msi)

This installer is only recommended for specific deployment scenarios where the other installers are unsuitable. The most common scenario is Microsoft RDS and Citrix deployments where a single shared installation is desired, typically for storage efficiency.

  
This installer is a "true" system-wide installer, unlike the Per-User MSI. The software is installed to a  
system-wide location and can be launched by all users of the system, including concurrently as in RDS  
and Citrix deployments.

#### Benefits 

- A single installation can be shared by all users on that machine
- Administrators have the control to manage updates
- Offers support for concurrent usage by multiple users on that machine

#### Notes

- Administrator rights are required for the initial installation and updates
- All product updates must be manually downloaded and installed
- System dependencies must be manually installed (e.g. .NET)

#### Installation

1. Run the installer with administrator rights
2. Follow the prompts, which will include entering the install location and entering the product key
3. Draftable Business is installed and ready to use
