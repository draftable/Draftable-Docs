title: "Installation Issues for the Word Add-in with Draftable Legal"
description: "If your seeing this article, its likely Draftable Legal has encountered a couple of issues that prevent the installation of our Word Add-in. There are two potential causes for this issue:"
---



1. The Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) Runtime is not installed.
2. The application cannot access `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Word\Addins`.

These issues prevent the complete functionality of our Word Add-in.

## Whats the issue?

### Issue 1: VSTO Runtime not installed

VSTO Runtime is a component required to run Microsoft Office-based solutions that are built by using Microsoft Visual Studio. This issue indicates that the VSTO Runtime, which is necessary to run our Word Add-in, is not installed on your system.

### Issue 2: Inaccessible Registry Key

The path `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Word\Addins` is a specific location in the Windows Registry where Microsoft Word Add-ins are registered. Our application needs to access this location to register our Word Add-in. The inability to access this Registry key may indicate that the current user account does not have the necessary permissions.

## Here's the solution
