title: "My Redline tracked changes comparison doesn't match my markup schema"
description: "If you are visiting this article, you may have used the Redline Tracked Changes and noticed that when you viewed the tracked changes comparison in Microsoft Word, the markup colours you expected were not as was shown."
---


This is a known interaction and this article explains what is happening and the workaround to update the colors for Redline tracked changes output.

## What you might be seeing in your tracked changes output

In Draftable Legal you select the colours chosen for the Redline Markup Schema, or at the very least, you are used to seeing the default red vs. blue text highlights for detections. 

Then you load a Redline Tracked Changes comparison in Word and see something like the example below:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/troubleshooting/image-59.png" alt="Redline tracked changes example" />
</Frame>

The colours may vary from the example shown above, but regardless it wasn't what you were expecting. 

What happening here is that **Draftable does not manage the colours used in Redline Tracked Changes comparisons** shown in Word**.** This is actually **managed by Word** itself, and below is the workaround you can perform to get the colours you want in your Redline Tracked Changes comparisons. 

## The workaround

You can set the colours for Redline Tracked Changes to appear as the colours you like within Mircosoft Word itself. This is recommended if you using Redline with Tracked changes often. 

Word automatically picks which colour represents each author (in this case being Draftable) and that colour might change when you reopen the document or someone else opens the document.

To set these colours, here is what you need to do. 
<Steps>
<Step>
Open Microsoft Word
</Step>
<Step>
Go to **Review,** and then select the small **Tracking Dialog Launcher** as shown in the image below:  
	<Frame>
	  <img src="/images/troubleshooting/image-60.png" alt="Tracking Dialog Launcher" />
	</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
A new window will appear, and then select **Advanced Options**.  
	<Frame>
	  <img src="/images/troubleshooting/image-61.png" alt="Advanced Options" />
	</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
The Advanced Track Changes window will open. You may notice that the colors for insertions and deletions are set to **By Author,** this is what we need to change. With the drop-down for the colours, choose and select the colours you wish to use for insertions and deletions.  
	<Frame>
	  <img src="/images/troubleshooting/image-62.png" alt="Advanced Track Changes window" />
	</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Change the colours to your desired selection, then click **OK** at the bottom of the window.  
	<Frame>
	  <img src="/images/troubleshooting/image-63.png" alt="Color selection" />
	</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
If you re-open your comparison, your selected colours should now apply for your Redline Tracked changes.  
	<Frame>
	  <img src="/images/troubleshooting/image-64.png" alt="Redline with selected colors" />
	</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>
