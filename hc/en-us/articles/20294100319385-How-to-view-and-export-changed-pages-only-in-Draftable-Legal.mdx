## Exporting Changed Pages in Draftable Legal

Draftable Legal also allows you to export only the pages of your document comparison that have changes. Here is how to do it:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Run a Redline comparison your comparison in New Comparison Window  
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-view-and-export-changed-pages/image-3.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    On the top ribbon menu of the comparison viewer, select **any** output options.  
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-view-and-export-changed-pages/image-4.png)  
        </Frame>
    All of the output options provide a Changed Pages export option. Hence, the user can choose which output method they wish to use for the Change Pages export. In the below example we used the **Save** option.  
        <Frame>
        ![](/images/using-draftable-view-and-export-changed-pages/image-5.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    After selecting any of the **Changed Pages PDF** options, you will be prompted to save the export to a location on your computer, DMS or open the export directly.
    </Step>
