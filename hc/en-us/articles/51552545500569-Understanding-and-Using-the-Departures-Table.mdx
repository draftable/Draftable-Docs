title: "Understanding and Using the Departures Table"
description: "The **Departures Table** (also known as an **Issues List**) is a new export option available in the **Redline comparison viewer** within Draftable Legal. This feature allows users to automatically generate a summarized table of key document changes, organized by clause, directly from their comparison results. <br /> <br /> This export provides a concise, clause-based summary of the differences between two versions of a document, helping legal teams to quickly identify and discuss departures during contract negotiations."

## What is a Departures Table?

The **Departures Table** output is a Microsoft Word document that lists all detected changes within a comparison, grouped under their relevant **clause or subclause headings** (e.g., “Clause 4(a)”). Each clause section contains:

- The **clause reference number and heading**
- The **full clause text** with redline markup showing insertions and deletions
- Optionally, additional formatting and content based on your organization’s Word template

This allows users to easily see how each clause has changed in context, without needing to manually extract and summarize changes from the full redline.  
  
See the example below, here is the content from the first page of an example Redline:

The equivalent departures table output looks like this:

</Frame>
<Note>
Note the columns that are created for this table to make it easy to review and share with other team members.
</Note>

1. Departure ID: Is the ID number of the change
2. Reference: Is the reference clause where the change was located
3. Proposed Departure: Is the departure (change) identified
4. Review notes: Is an example text field that users can collaborate on between team members
5. Commercial impact: Is another example text field that users can collaborate on between team members

The departure table itself is based on a editable template which can be curated to your teams needs, read further below for more information.  

## Key Benefits

- **Faster review:** Eliminate the manual process of compiling clause-by-clause changes into a departures or issues list.
- **Improved collaboration:** Ideal for negotiation tables or internal review meetings.
- **Customizable templates:** Firms can apply their own **Word template** to standardize branding and structure.
- **Works with existing workflows:** Export the Departures Table through the same export options you already use in Draftable Legal.
