New to our documentation? No worries! This guide will walk you through all the navigation elements so you can find exactly what you're looking for.

## AI Docs Assistant

The fastest way to find what you're looking for—especially if you don't know where it is—is to use our **AI Docs Assistant**. Simply ask a question and let it search through our entire documentation to give you a direct answer with links to relevant articles.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-to-navigate-our-docs/ai-assistant-placeholder.png" alt="The AI Docs Assistant button and chat interface." />
</Frame>

**How to use it:**

1. Click the "Ask a question" button seen at the bottom of the webpage (or press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on Mac / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on Windows)
2. Type your question in natural language
3. The assistant will search our docs and provide an answer with source links

<Tip>
  The AI assistant works best with specific questions like "How do I configure iManage integration?" rather than broad ones like "Tell me about Draftable".
</Tip>

## The Product Menu

The Product Menu is your starting point for navigating our documentation. It's the dropdown at the top of the sidebar that lets you switch between different Draftable products and sections.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-to-navigate-our-docs/product-menu-placeholder.png" alt="The Product Menu dropdown showing all available Draftable products and documentation sections." />
</Frame>

Here's what you'll find in the Product Menu:

| Section | What's inside |
|---------|---------------|
| **Welcome to Draftable** | Getting started with Draftable, security info, and contact details |
| **Release Notes** | Latest updates and changes for our products |
| **Draftable Legal** | Everything for our enterprise legal comparison tool |
| **Draftable Business** | Guides for our general document comparison solution |
| **Draftable API** | Documentation for our cloud-hosted REST API |
| **Draftable API Self-Hosted** | Guides for deploying the API on your own infrastructure |

Simply click on the Product Menu and select the section you need. The sidebar will update to show all the relevant content for that product.

## Version Selector

Some products have multiple versions. For example, **Draftable API Self-Hosted** has both v2 (legacy) and v3 (latest) versions.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-to-navigate-our-docs/version-selector-placeholder.png" alt="The version selector dropdown showing v2 and v3 options for Draftable API Self-Hosted." />
</Frame>

When you're in a product with multiple versions, you'll see a version dropdown. Click it to switch between versions and see documentation specific to that release.

<Tip>
  If you're setting up a new deployment, we recommend starting with **v3** as it's our latest and most improved version.
</Tip>

## Tabs

Once you've selected a product, you'll see **Tabs** at the top of the content area. These organize the documentation into logical sections based on what you're trying to do.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-to-navigate-our-docs/tabs-placeholder.png" alt="The tabs navigation showing different sections like User Onboarding Track and Deployment Track." />
</Frame>

For example, in **Draftable Legal**, you'll find tabs like:

- **User Academy** - For end users learning to use the product
- **Administrator Deployment Track** - For IT teams deploying and configuring
- **Overview & Configuration** - General setup and requirements
- **DMS Integrations** - Connecting with iManage, NetDocuments, SharePoint, etc.
- **FAQ & Troubleshooting** - Common questions and solutions

Click on a tab to see all the articles and guides related to that topic.

## Sidebar Navigation

The **Sidebar** on the left shows all the articles available within your current tab. Articles are organized into collapsible **Article Groups** to make it easier to find what you need.

### Article Groups

Article Groups are the collapsible sections in the sidebar. They bundle related articles together under a common heading.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-to-navigate-our-docs/article-groups-placeholder.png" alt="Expanded and collapsed article groups in the sidebar showing how articles are organized." />
</Frame>

For example, under the DMS Integrations tab in the Draftable Legal product, you'll see groups like:

- **iManage** - All articles about iManage integration
- **NetDocuments** - NetDocuments setup and usage
- **SharePoint** - SharePoint configuration guides
- **Worldox** - Worldox integration docs

Click on a group to expand or collapse it, then click on an article to read it.

## Search

The fastest way to find something specific is to use **Search**. You'll find the search bar at the top of every page.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-to-navigate-our-docs/search-bar-placeholder.png" alt="The search bar showing the keyboard shortcut and search functionality." />
</Frame>

**Quick tips for searching:**

- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> (Mac) to open search instantly
- Type keywords related to what you're looking for
- Results will show matching articles across all products
