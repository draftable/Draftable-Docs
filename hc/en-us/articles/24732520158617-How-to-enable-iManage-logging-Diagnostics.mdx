This article provides the method for how to activate this logging feature so that additional iManage diagnostic log files can be captured.

## How to enable the iManage logging option

Firstly, we need to open the settings menu, this can be done in a few ways:
1. Open settings via the Taskbar
   <Steps>
    <Step>
	Right-click the **Draftable** icon in the taskbar
    </Step>
    <Step>
	 Select **Settings** as the 2nd option

		</Frame>
    </Step>
    </Steps>
2. Or, open the settings menu via the New Comparison Window  
   <Steps>
    <Step>  
	 Open the [New Comparison window](/hc/en-us/articles/19002140760217-Launching-a-Comparison-in-Draftable-Legal-A-Step-by-Step-Guide)
    </Step>
    <Step>
	 Select **Settings** in the top right of the window    
		<Frame>
		![](/images/using-draftable-legal-with-iManage/image-122.png)
		</Frame>
    </Step>
    </Steps>
Once the settings menu is open navigate to the **Integrations** section. Here you can access the **Enable extra logging for iManage integration.**

Select this menu option as highlighted below if you require additional logging for iManage integration to be enabled.

If you have a persisting iManage issue, and you have ensured that iManage logging is enabled, we recommend you reproduce the issue, and then export the Draftable logs. 

This can be found in the **Troubleshooting** section where you will export a zip file of all the logs, and we then recommend you email these logs to us at [support@draftable.com] where we will investigate your issue further from there.
