**Draftable in Office** is a modern Word add-in that brings Draftable's powerful document comparison functionality directly into Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint. This feature enables users to perform comparisons, manage versions, and review results — all within the familiar Office interface.

<Note>
Draftable in Office requires **Draftable version 25.10.000 or later** to be installed and running on the user's system.

This article only shows the workflow for Microsoft Word at this time.
</Note>

Once installed, the add-in appears under the **Home** tab in Microsoft Word.

## Draftable in Office Workflow

The Draftable in Office workflow integrates directly into Microsoft Word, allowing you to compare open documents, recent files, and versions — without needing to leave Word. The add-in opens a **Draftable interface panel** on the right-hand side of the Word window, where users can select files, run comparisons, and view results.

### Workflow options using Draftable within Word

Under the **Home** tab, you'll find three primary buttons:

#### 1. Draftable in Office

Selecting the **Draftable** button opens the Draftable panel on the right-hand side of Word. From here, you can choose which documents or content to use for comparison on the **Left** and **Right** sides.

Each side offers the following options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Current document** | Uses the currently open document as one of the comparison files. |
| **Enter text** | Allows manual entry of raw text for comparison. |
| **Browse files** | Opens a file browser for selecting files, including DMS integrations. |
| **Recent files** | Displays recently compared documents for quick selection. |

After selecting your documents and running the comparison, you can open the result in Draftable Legal or use one of the export options to **save**, **email**, **copy**, or **print** the comparison.

#### 2. Compare Open Documents

The **Compare Open** option lists all documents currently open in Word, allowing you to quickly select two to compare. This is useful when working on multiple files simultaneously within Word.

Recent documents are also displayed for convenience. Once the comparison is complete, the same export workflows (open, save, email, copy, or print) are available.

#### 3. Compare Versions

The **Compare Versions** feature allows you to easily compare different versions of the same document — ideal for version-controlled files (e.g., from iManage, NetDocuments, or SharePoint).

You can also **refresh versions** if a new version has been saved or published.

Just like other comparison modes, results can be opened in Draftable Legal or exported using the available workflows.

### Direct to Draftable Options

You don't have to work directly within Word if you don't want to with your active document; you can still send the current document directly to the Draftable application.

#### Send as Older

Opens the **Draftable New Comparison window** with the active Word document preloaded as the **older (left)** document. You can then select the newer document in Draftable to complete the comparison.

#### Send as Newer

Opens the **Draftable New Comparison window** with the active Word document preloaded as the **newer (right)** document. You can then select the older document to complete the comparison.

## Additional Settings

Within the **Draftable in Office** panel, you'll find several configuration options that help personalize your in-Word comparison experience.

### Profiles

You can select which **comparison profile** to use for your comparisons directly within the Word add-in. Profiles allow administrators or users to predefine comparison settings such as markup style, color scheme, and formatting preferences.

### Light/Dark Modes

Next to the profile selector is a theme toggle, allowing you to switch between **Light**, **Dark**, and **Auto** color modes to suit your preference or Word theme.

### Language

In the same section, you can also choose the **language** that Draftable in Office operates in. This setting affects the add-in's interface and messages within Word.

## Notes

- Draftable in Office requires **Draftable version 25.10.000 or later** to be installed and running on the user's device. We recommend running **25.12.000 or later** if possible.
- Comparisons performed in Word use the same engine as Draftable Legal, ensuring identical accuracy and output consistency.
- You can continue working within Word while running comparisons in the Draftable pane.
- When multiple comparisons are active, they can be managed or switched between via tabs in the right-hand pane.
