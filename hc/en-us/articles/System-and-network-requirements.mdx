## Network Requirements

Draftable Legal requires network connectivity for license verification, software updates, error reporting, and telemetry. Some of these functions can be disabled.

### License Verification

On launch, the application will verify the product license by connecting to Draftable license servers.

|:---------|:------|
| Host | draftable.com |
| Port | 443 |
| Protocol | HTTPS |
| Required | Yes |

### Software Updates

| Host | draftable.com |
| Port | 443 |
