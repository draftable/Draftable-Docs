## Reviewing comparison results

### Redline viewer

The **Redline comparison viewer** makes it easy to review changes.

The Change List is shown on the right-hand side of the Comparison Viewer. [You can read more about Change List features here](/hc/en-us/articles/32514479509785-Using-the-Redline-Change-List-to-review-filter-tag-add-notes-and-export-your-changes).

These options allow you to quickly and easily share comparisons via your preferred method or DMS. A quick summary of these options are:

- **Open** the results directly in your preferred Word processor or PDF reader.

## Other Comparison Types

You can read more about [how to select the right Comparison Type here](/hc/en-us/articles/33190528521881-Comparison-Type-How-to-choose-the-right-option-in-the-Draftable-New-Comparison-Window). Below we explain three other Comparison Types that are used for legal comparisons of Word documents (docx) and PDF files.

### Side by Side

This allows you to compare two documents and have them shown on a comparison screen in a Side by Side view. This can make it very easy to see the differences between two documents and works best for PDF files (but Word files are also supported). Side by Side comparisons also have the option to create a comparison output (or export), and is very useful when comparing Excel and PowerPoint files. 

### Tracked Changes in Word

The Tracked Changes comparison type will generate a Word document (.docx) with the changes marked up as Track Changes. Once ready, you will be prompted to either save or open the output. This will open in Word and let you use Word's inbuilt Tracked Changes functionality to navigate through changes & accept/reject changes.

### Redline in Word

This Comparison Type is designed for users who prefer to work in Word but require a redline that does not contain any tracked changes metadata. It creates a comparison output as a Word (docx) file with static markup (i.e. the text is altered to reflect the markup but there are no 'changes' to review). This is particularly useful when using metadata cleaning tools that would otherwise remove tracked changes information.
