For Draftable API users, access control to customer data is handled at the application layer. Customer data is stored in the same underlying storage repositories (AWS S3, AWS RDS), which are owned by Draftable.

Whilst we retain ownership of the underlying hardware, due to the nature of the application layer handling we do not have direct access to customer data.
