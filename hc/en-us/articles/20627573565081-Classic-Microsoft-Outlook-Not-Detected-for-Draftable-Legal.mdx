title: "Classic Microsoft Outlook Not Detected for Draftable Legal"
description: "If you are seeing this article, it is likely that Draftable Legal has detected that the classic Microsoft Outlook is not installed on your system. As our application uses the COM interface to open and set up emails with attachments, it requires the classic desktop version of Outlook, not the web or mobile versions."

## What's the issue?

COM (Component Object Model) interface is a binary-interface standard for software components introduced by Microsoft in 1993. It allows Draftable Pro to communicate with the Outlook desktop application to perform various tasks, such as opening an email or adding attachments. However, this functionality is not available in the web or mobile versions of Outlook, which is why the classic version of Outlook is required.

## Here's the solution

Here's how you can install the classic desktop version of Microsoft Outlook:

1. **Purchase Microsoft Outlook:** Visit the Microsoft Store or another reputable software retailer to purchase the desktop version of Microsoft Outlook. It is typically available as part of the Microsoft Office Suite, either as a one-time purchase or through a Microsoft 365 subscription.
2. **Download and Install**: Once purchased, download the setup file for the Microsoft Office suite. Launch the setup file and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to select the "Customize" option during the installation process to ensure that Microsoft Outlook is included in the installation.
3. **Update your Office Suite**: If you already have a different version of the Office Suite installed, you might be able to update your package to include the classic version of Microsoft Outlook through your Microsoft 365 subscription. Navigate to your Office Account settings, check for available updates or customization options, and add Outlook if possible.
