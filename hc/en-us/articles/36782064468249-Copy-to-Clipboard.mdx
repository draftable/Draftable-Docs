title: "Copy to Clipboard"
description: "Draftable Legal allows you to copy comparison outputs to the clipboard, instead of having to save or email them. This is useful if for example you have an email you are working on and want to attach the comparison files to it. You can use the Copy to Clipboard feature instead of having to save the files first and the adding them to the email."

    You can also change the file format of the Redline and the Original and Modified files. You can pick either PDF or DOCX file formats. Track Changes has to remain as a DOCX file though.

    With the **Changes Report** option, you can again decide on the file format, this time the options are DOCX and CSV, while also choosing what changes you want in the report. You can either choose All Changes, are choose to just show the changes you have selected in the Filter you have set on the Change List panel on the right hand side.
