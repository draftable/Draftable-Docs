## Purpose of the PDF Conversion Engine Setting

The PDF conversion engine setting in Draftable Legal's 'General' tab of the settings menu is designed to determine how the application handles the conversion of Word documents (DOCX) to PDFs during the document comparison process. This setting significantly impacts the speed and reliability of your document comparisons.

## Importance of the Setting

Selecting the appropriate PDF conversion engine is crucial because it directly influences the performance of your comparisons when using the 'Redline in Draftable' comparison type. The setting allows users to choose between Draftable's internal conversion engine and Microsoft Word's conversion engine. Each option has its own advantages, depending on your specific needs and any issues you might encounter.

## Recommended Settings

**Draftable Engine**: This is the recommended setting for most users. It provides faster and more reliable comparisons within Draftable Legal. The Draftable Engine is optimized for the software, ensuring that document comparisons are performed efficiently and accurately.

**MS Word**: This setting should be used if users experience PDF rendering issues. The MS Word engine utilizes Microsoft's capabilities to convert documents, which can be beneficial in cases where the Draftable Engine produces poor formatting in PDF outputs.
