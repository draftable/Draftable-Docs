</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
After running a **Redline in Draftable** comparison, the Draftable Viewer will open. Click on the **Save to Worldox** option in the **Draftable Ribbon** found at the top of the Draftable Viewer. This expands the submenu for saving to Worldox.

This will bring up the **Comparison Results options**:

</Frame>

You can then select from one of the below options:

**Redline:** This saves into a .pdf or .docx file where all changes are marked or "redlined" over the base document. This layout allows for easy visual comparison between the original and new versions of the document.

**Changed Pages Only:** This is similar to the Redline option, but it only includes pages where changes have occurred. This is a useful feature if you're dealing with lengthy documents and you want to focus just on the pages with modifications. Can only be saved as a .PDF.

**Tracked Changes:** This saves into a .docx file with all updates embedded as 'Tracked Changes' in Microsoft Word. This is useful for further editing or reviewing in Word, as you can accept or reject changes individually and keep a record of who made what changes and when.

**Changes Report:** This will save a summary of the document changes found within the Redline. You can pick to either save this in a DOCX or a CSV file format and show all the Reported changes, or just those Matching the filters you have set in the Change List panel.

Also, if you click on the **"Options'** link at the top of the Comparison Results pop up window, you will also see three additional choices.

</Frame>

**Summary page:** Includes a brief summary of the number of changes made, as well at the Markup Schema used for the Redline.

**Changes report:** Includes the full changes report either at the start of the document or at the end.

**Reported changes:** Allows change report to either include or the changes in the comparison or just those that you displayed via the filter options.
</Step>
<Step>
**Select the file type** you wish to save and a Worldox save dialog (pictured) will appear shortly after Draftable opens a save window. Enter the required metadata and select **OK** when ready to save as a new file.

<Note>
**Note:** you can save as a new version or related file via the same Worldox dialog.
