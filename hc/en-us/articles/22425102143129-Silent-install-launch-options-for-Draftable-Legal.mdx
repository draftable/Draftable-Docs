## Installation 

Various silent installation parameters are required to be parsed for the silent installation of Draftable Legal. These differ for each of the different installer types:

### Default Installer 

The silent install parameter `-s|--silent` is required for the default installer. 

Hence an example of installing the default installer silently is:

```bash
C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\DraftableDesktopSetup.exe --silent
```

### Machine Wide MSI

To install the Machine-wide MSI installer silently, use the `/quiet` command-line parameter. We have two examples that can apply to the machine-wide MSI. 

#### Example 1: Install silently into a custom location

```bash
msiexec /i DraftableSetupSystem.msi /quiet INSTALLDIR="C:\Apps\Draftable\Desktop"
```

#### Example 2: Install silently without a desktop shortcut

```bash
msiexec /i DraftableSetupSystem.msi /quiet ADDLOCAL=DraftableDesktop, StartMenuShortcut
```

## Silent launch parameters 

There are various ways to configure the launch behaviour for Draftable Legal. 

### Within Draftable Legal settings

There are 3 options here:

1. Start Automatically: This starts Draftable Legal when Windows launches, the New Comparison Window will be shown on the main desktop after Windows has been booted. 

2. Not Start with Windows: Draftable Legal does not start at all, and the user will need to manually open the program. 

3. Silent start: This is our silent option, it starts Draftable Legal in the background when Windows starts, but does not launch the New Comparison window. 

### Group Policy option 

You can configure the default behaviour for the Draftable Legal start option via Group Policy options, specifically the 'Launch Draftable Automatically when Windows Start' option.
