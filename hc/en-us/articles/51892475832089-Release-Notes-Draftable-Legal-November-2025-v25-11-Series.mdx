## Core Functionality

### Run Draftable comparisons entirely inside Word, Excel and PowerPoint

We know lawyers do most of their work in Microsoft Office. Comparison workflows often start in Word, Excel or PowerPoint. Switching from MS Office to the Draftable Desktop application can be inconvenient at best and painfully frustrating when deadlines are looming. That's why we've built our most advanced Office add-in yet: **"Draftable in Office"**.

This new Microsoft Office JavaScript (JS) Add-In allows users to access full comparison workflows from within Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint — including initiating comparisons, viewing redlines, and saving/exporting all directly within the Office interface. The November 2025 updates to Draftable Desktop have included updated back end to support the new add-ins, which will be available for download and provisioning in early December 2025.

This is a major improvement for firms standardizing on Microsoft 365 and enables a more integrated experience for fee earners working directly in Office applications.

### Improved accuracy around deleted paragraphs

Comparisons now offer greater positional accuracy in cases where paragraphs are removed. Updated handling ensures that text changes surrounding deleted sections are located and marked with improved precision, reducing false positives in these scenarios.

### Support for smart-tag content comparison

Draftable Legal now identifies and compares smart-tag content within legal documents. This enhancement ensures no content is missed during markup, even when embedded metadata or smart-tagged values are used to track client names, dates, or other key information.

## Markup Configuration

### Remove clutter from redlines by ignoring whitespace changes

A new Redline profile setting allows users to ignore changes consisting solely of whitespace (e.g., added spaces, tabs, or line breaks). This helps reduce noise in comparison results and lets reviewers focus on substantive changes.

This setting can be toggled on or off in settings via **Redline > Word - Comparison options** section, or configured via Registry or Group Policy.

## Ease of Use

### Draftable now remembers your preferred window size

Draftable Legal will now open using the window size last used by the user, instead of defaulting to full screen. This change supports consistent user preferences across sessions and improves multitasking on split-screen setups.

### View results in a new tab without losing your comparison screen

A new setting allows the Viewer to open in a separate tab, so the original comparison window stays open. This makes it easier to change files or settings and rerun comparisons without reloading inputs. It also ensures that closing a comparison doesn't fully exit the app.

## Integration Functions

### Word, Excel and PowerPoint: Standardized DMS file naming conventions

The Draftable file selection panel inside of Office now displays the DMS filename, document ID, and version instead of raw file paths. This change improves clarity when launching comparisons via the "Compare Open" panel, especially when working concurrently with many files.

## Administrator Features

### Outlook: Customizable email body text

Administrators can now configure via Group Policy the default body text used when Draftable Legal generates an Outlook email containing comparison results. This setting allows firms to standardize language for outbound redlines and tailor it to internal review or client delivery requirements.
