title: "Issues Overriding MS Word Settings in Draftable Legal"
description: "If you are seeing this article, it is likely that Draftable Legal has encountered an issue while attempting to override certain Microsoft Word settings. This problem typically arises from user permissions or group policies that restrict changes to the configuration we're attempting to set."

## What's the issue?

Our application requires the ability to modify specific Word settings to provide its full functionality. However, in certain environments, changes to these settings may be restricted due to user permissions or group policies set by system administrators. This could limit our application's ability to perform certain tasks or operations.

## Here's the solution

To resolve this issue, we can try two potential solutions:

1. **Run as Administrator:** If the problem is related to user permissions, running the application as an administrator might resolve the issue. Right-click on our application's icon and select "Run as administrator". Keep in mind that this method gives the application higher privileges, so it should only be done if you trust the application.
2. **Check Group Policies:** If you're part of an organization, your IT department may have set group policies that restrict changes to Word settings. Contact your system administrator or IT department and explain the issue. They may be able to adjust the group policies or provide you with a workaround.

## What if the problem persists?

If these solutions don't work, please reach out to our support team for further assistance. You can contact our customer support team for help at [support@draftable.com](mailto:support@draftable.com)
