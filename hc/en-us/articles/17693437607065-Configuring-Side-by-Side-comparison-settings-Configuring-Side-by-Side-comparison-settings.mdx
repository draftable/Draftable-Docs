## Comparison options 

Comparison options can be controlled by the user to control how the comparison behaves and looks.

**Ignore changes inside Headers and Footers:** Setting this will instruct the comparison not to detect content within headers and footers which include page numbering changes. This is an experimental feature that may not provide full accuracy.

**Enable moves:** This setting allows you to toggle the 'moves' detection, which detects whether content has been moved positionally between the documents.

**Font size sensitivity:** This setting allows you to set the threshold for font size detection (style changes) within side-by-side comparisons

- **Sensitive:** Detects all changes in font size
- **Somewhat sensitive:** Detects only changes in font size that is at least 1pt greater
- **Significant:** Detects only changes in font size that is at least 2pt greater

## Viewer options

There are specific options for the viewer itself for side-by-side comparisons.

**Change list default state:** This sets the default state for the change list that is shown when viewing comparisons.
