## Saving comparison files to automatically open in iManage

If you select **Tracked Changes in Word** you will have the option to **save directly to iManage** as a new file, a new related file or new version by **selecting the down arrow** on the right side of the **Save** option

If you select **Redline in Draftable** or **Side by Side**, your comparison will open in the Draftable Viewer. In this example, we will show the workflow with a Redline in Draftable but the approach is the same for Side by Side. 
<Steps>
<Step>
In the **Draftable Viewer,** select the **Save to DMS icon** n the Ribbon at the viewer.

 After selecting how you want to save the comparison, you can then go ahead and pick which format and type of comparison you would like to save, so either the **Redline, Changed Pages Only, Tracked Changes** or **Changes Report.**
