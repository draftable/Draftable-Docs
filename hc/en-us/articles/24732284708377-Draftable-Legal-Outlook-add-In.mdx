## Where do I find the Draftable Add-in within Outlook?

Open any email that you wish to compare with the documents attached or the text itself within the email. Below is an example email used to show how this process is done.

Now you will be presented with two icons, one for **Compare** and another for **Compare text.** **Compare** allows you to select documents attached in the email for compare, whilst **Compare text** allows you to highlight text within the email to directly add to the New Comparison window for text compare.
