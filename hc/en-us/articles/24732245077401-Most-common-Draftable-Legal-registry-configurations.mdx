title: "Most common Draftable Legal registry configurations"
description: "This is an article intended for administrator level users, who wish to make certain configurations to the registry of user computers, to set values directly to the registry. This is an alternative method of Draftable legal user machine configuration as opposed to using something like group policy."

## Registry configurations

Below are a series of different registry configurations you can use to set user machine values directly for Draftable legal. They are grouped by the category of settings/configuration each registry key belongs to.
<Note>
**Please note**: By default Draftable will prioritize registry keys set in the "CURRENT\_USER" registry folders, and will then prioritize "LOCAL\_MACHINE" registry keys if keys are not found in "CURRENT\_USER". This will apply to users wanting to use "LOCAL\_MACHINE" to apply keys, so they do not have to configure each different individual user account.
</Note>
<Warning>
Please **be aware,** that if you wish to set the registry keys in the "LOCAL\_MACHINE" section, the location slightly differs from the "CURRENT\_USER" location, as it's not mirrored. Hence, the default location for Draftable registry keys in "LOCAL\_MACHINE" is HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Draftable\\
</Warning>
Hence, **do not use** HKLM:\\Software\\Draftable\\ for "LOCAL\_MACHINE" registry configurations.
