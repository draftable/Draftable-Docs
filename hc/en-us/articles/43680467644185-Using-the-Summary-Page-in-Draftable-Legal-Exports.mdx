You can control how the **Summary Page** is included in your exported comparison files by adjusting the **Default Summary Page Placement** setting.

## Configuring the Summary Page Placement

To customize how the **Summary Page** appears in your comparison exports, there are two methods:

### Configuring the summary page at the time of export 

<Steps>
<Step>
Whilst in the **comparison viewer,** select your desired export option via the ribbon menu   
	<Frame>
    ![](/images//using-draftable-summary-page/image-2.png)  
	</Frame>
	In the above example, we will select the **save option**
</Step>
<Step>
When the export menu opens, note that there is text marked as "Options", go ahead and click this text:  
	<Frame>
    ![](/images//using-draftable-summary-page/image-3.png)
	</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Once clicked you will have an option to set the summary page behaviour, there are three options:  
	<Frame>
    ![](/images//using-draftable-summary-page/image-4.png)  
	</Frame>
	- **Do not include** – The Summary Page will **not** be added to your export.
	- **Include at start** – The Summary Page appears at the **beginning** of the comparison.
	- **Include at end** – The Summary Page appears at the **end** of the comparison.
</Step>
<Step>
Continue with your export workflow with the summary page option selected. The export option will include the summary page if you have selected it (either at the start or end of the export).
</Step>
</Steps>

	- **Do not include** – The Summary Page will **not** be added to your export.
	- **Include at start** – The Summary Page appears at the **beginning** of the comparison.
	- **Include at end** – The Summary Page appears at the **end** of the comparison.
	- **Include at start and end** – The Summary Page appears **both at the start and end** of the comparison.
</Step>
</Steps>

## How This Affects Your Exports

The **Summary Page Placement** setting applies to all export document formats in Draftable Legal.

If your workflow requires a **quick reference summary**, including the Summary Page at the start or end of the document can help improve review efficiency.
