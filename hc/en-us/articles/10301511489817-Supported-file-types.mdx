### Known issue

Sometimes, documents generated by non-Microsoft products (e.g. Google Docs) may have issues when comparing with Draftable, as they do not adhere to the Open XML specifications.  We highly recommend conducting thorough testing on documents relevant to your specific use-case to determine if this is the case for you.

A workaround that often proves effective is to re-save the document using Microsoft Word/PowerPoint. This process can sometimes repair any malformed sections of the document, ensuring better compatibility with Draftable.
