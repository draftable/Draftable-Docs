## Synced SharePoint

You can sync your Microsoft SharePoint files directly to your computer's folder for offline access and direct work in file explorer. This is available for organizations with a Microsoft 365 work/school subscription or using SharePoint Server 2019 and Teams.

It is important to understand that OneDrive is used as part of this process, and if you want to learn more about this please visit the [official documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sync-sharepoint-and-teams-files-with-your-computer-6de9ede8-5b6e-4503-80b2-6190f3354a88).

## How to compare files directly from a SharePoint Online location

Draftable can also compare files directly from your SharePoint Online instance, without the need of having to sync the files to your computer. In order to do this, you must first install the Draftable App for SharePoint Online which is explained in more details [Here](/hc/en-us/articles/25571809846297-Configuring-Sharepoint-Online-to-launch-directly-into-Draftable)

<Steps>
<Step>
Once the Draftable App for SharePoint Online has been installed and configured, you can then open your SharePoint instance in a Web Browser and navigate to where the documents you wish to compare are located. You then have three options with which to initiate a Comparison.

i) Via the ribbon at the top of the window. Here you see three options:-

1. **Compare** which will load the selected file into the "Select Older Document" pane in the New Comparison window.

2. **Compare Version(s)** which will pop up a new window, with and display all the versions of the file you have selected

3. **1-Click Compare**, which will generate a comparison based on the settings you configured in the Draftable Settings. You can find more information about the 1-Click Compare feature [Here](/hc/en-us/articles/31611819497753-Using-1-Click-Compare-to-run-comparisons-with-your-preferred-default-workflow)

ii) Via the right click context menu. you will also see the same three options for Compare, Compare Version(s) and 1-Click Compare that are mentioned above
