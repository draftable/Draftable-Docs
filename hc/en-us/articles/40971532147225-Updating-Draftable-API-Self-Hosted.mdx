**Prerequisites**

1. Ensure you have administrative access to the server running the Draftable API Self-Hosted instance.
2. Verify that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on the server.

## Steps to Update the Draftable API Self-Hosted Instance

<Steps>
<Step>
Pull the Latest Docker Image

Use the `docker pull` command to download the latest image from the Draftable repository:

`docker pull draftable/apish:latest `

This command ensures that the most recent version of the image is downloaded to your server.
</Step>
<Step>
Update the `docker-compose.yml` File

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines how your container is configured and deployed. Locate this file in the directory where your Draftable API instance is hosted.

- Open the file in a your preferred text editor.
- Update the `image` field under the `services` section to ensure it references the latest image:

```json
version: '3.5'
services:
  apish: 
    environment:    
      DRAFTABLE_APISH_NGINX: |-          
    image: draftable/apish:latest #The term 'Latest' always ensures you are using the latest version
    ports:
       - 80:80/tcp         
       - 0.0.0.0:8440:443/tcp      
    volumes:       
      - draftable-apish:/srv/draftable
      - /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup   
volumes: 
  draftable-apish:
```
- Save and exit the editor
</Step>
<Step>
Restart the Container

Start by shutting down the container:

`docker-compose down`  
  
Then restart the container with:  
`docker-compose up`

To apply the updates, restart your container with the updated configuration:
