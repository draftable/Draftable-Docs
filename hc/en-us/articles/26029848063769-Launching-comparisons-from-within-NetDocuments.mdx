## How to launch comparisons directly from NetDocuments

There are a few methods to launch comparisons from NetDocuments, either using external context menus or the toolbar. To ensure that you are getting the full usage of this feature, below outlines all the possible workstreams for launching comparisons directly from NetDocuments.

### Launching comparisons via the context menu

<Steps>
<Step>
On your enterprise's online NetDocuments instance, **navigate to your desired files** for comparison

<Frame>

</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Select a file, **right-click** it, and then select **Send to application**

**Alternatively,** you can also select two files, **right-click** them, and then select **Send to application**

<Frame>
![](/images/using-draftable-legal-with-netDocument/image-3.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
This will launch the **Send to Application window**. Verify the documents you have selected under **Marked Items**. If selecting multiple file versions at once, these will all appear in the Marked Items section. Once files are selected, you have 3 comparison options: "Draftable Compare Versions", "Draftable Compare Latest" or "Draftable Compare"

</Step>
</Steps>

### Draftable compare versions

**For files with only 2 versions**, this option will automatically **load the two versions** of the selected document. For **files with 3 or more versions**, this option will **open the Draftable version selector menu** to show a list of versions for loading. Users are able to **select up to two versions** for comparison, and then load by clicking '**Select**'.

### Draftable Compare Latest

This option uses smart logic to load file versions for comparison. If a **file is selected**, Draftable Compare Latest will load the **two latest** **versions** of the document, so you will not be prompted to select any specific versions. If a **file version** is selected, Draftable Compare Latest will **load the selected version and the most recent other version available**. For example, if a file has 4 versions (V1-V4) and V1 is selected, it will load V1 and V4. In the same example, if V4 is selected, it will load V3 and V4.

### Draftable Compare

This loads only the selected document into the **newer** (left) side of **Draftable Legal**

<Note>
**Note:** When loading files you may be prompted with a **confirmation box**. Simply press **Open Draftable** to progress
