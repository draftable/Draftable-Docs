description: "Troubleshooting guide for when Draftable Office Add-ins (Word, Excel, Outlook) do not load correctly after installing via the MSI installer. This is typically caused by incorrect LoadBehavior registry values."
---

If you have installed Draftable Legal using the MSI installer and the Office Add-ins (Word, Excel, or Outlook) are not loading correctly or showing as unavailable in the Draftable Add-ins tab, this may be due to the **LoadBehavior** registry value not being set correctly.

## Checking Add-in Status in Draftable Legal

Before investigating the registry, you can check the status of your add-ins directly within Draftable Legal.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Draftable Legal Settings">
Open Draftable Legal and navigate to **Settings** > **Add-ins** tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Add-in Status">
The Add-ins tab displays all installed Draftable add-ins and their current status.

</Frame>

When add-ins are working correctly, they will show as loaded. However, if you see a **"Failed"** status against any add-in, this indicates there is an issue with that add-in loading correctly.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If any add-in shows a **"Failed"** status, you will need to investigate the LoadBehavior registry value for that specific add-in as described below.
</Warning>

## Understanding LoadBehavior

Microsoft Office uses a registry value called `LoadBehavior` to determine how and when add-ins should be loaded. According to [Microsoft's documentation on keeping add-ins enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/outlook/concepts/getting-started/support-for-keeping-add-ins-enabled), the LoadBehavior value controls the loading behavior of COM add-ins.

For Draftable Add-ins to load correctly at startup, the **LoadBehavior value must be set to `3`** (Load at startup).

<Note>
If the LoadBehavior is not set to `3`, the Add-ins may not load correctly and can show false positives within the Draftable Add-ins tab, appearing as if they are installed but not functioning.
</Note>

## How to Check and Fix LoadBehavior

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Registry Editor">
Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter to open the Windows Registry Editor.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to the Add-in Registry Keys">
Check the LoadBehavior value for each Office application where the add-in is not loading:

**For Outlook:**
```
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Addins\Draftable.CompareTool.OutlookAddIn
```

**For Word:**
```
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Word\Addins\Draftable.CompareTool.WordAddIn
```

**For Excel:**
```
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Excel\Addins\Draftable.CompareTool.ExcelAddIn
```

<Note>
**Machine-wide installation?** Depending on your installation type and end-user machine configuration, the registry keys may be located under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` instead of `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`. If you cannot find the keys in the CURRENT_USER location, check the following paths:

- `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Addins\Draftable.CompareTool.OutlookAddIn`
- `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\Word\Addins\Draftable.CompareTool.WordAddIn`
- `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\Excel\Addins\Draftable.CompareTool.ExcelAddIn`
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Check the LoadBehavior Value">
In each of the registry locations above, look for a DWORD value named `LoadBehavior`.

<Frame>
![LoadBehavior registry value in Windows Registry Editor](/images/Office-Add-ins-Not-Loading-After-MSI-Installation/1.png)
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Set LoadBehavior to 3">
If the `LoadBehavior` value is not set to `3`, double-click on it and change the value to `3`.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Do not load automatically |
| 1 | Do not load automatically |
| 2 | Load at startup (but not connected) |
| **3** | **Load at startup (recommended)** |
| 9 | Load on demand |
| 16 | Load first time, then load on demand |
</Step>

<Step title="Restart Office Applications">
After changing the LoadBehavior value, close and restart the affected Office application(s) for the changes to take effect.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Deploying the Fix via Group Policy

For enterprise deployments, administrators can ensure the correct LoadBehavior is set via Group Policy or during the MSI installation process. Contact your IT administrator to configure the registry values centrally.

## Still Having Issues?

If you have verified that the LoadBehavior is set to `3` and the add-ins still do not load:

1. Check that the add-in is not disabled in the Office application's **COM Add-ins** settings
2. Verify that Draftable Legal is installed and running correctly
3. Try [manually re-installing the add-in](/hc/en-us/articles/30861499917337-How-to-manually-re-install-the-Draftable-MS-Word-Add-in)
