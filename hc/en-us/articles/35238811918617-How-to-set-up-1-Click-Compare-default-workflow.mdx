If you are an end user who wants to update your own default workflow for 1-Click Compare, see [this article](/hc/en-us/articles/31611819497753-Using-1-Click-Compare-to-run-comparisons-with-your-preferred-default-workflow) instead. 

## What is 1-Click Compare?

1-Click Compare gets you to your preferred next action in "1-Click". Users can launch a comparison of two files and generate their chosen 'next action' without any further steps. For example, you can use 1-Click Compare to go straight from selecting your files to:

- Creating an email with redline outputs and input files attached
- Copying input files and comparison outputs to your clipboard
- Immediately printing your preferred comparison output
- Saving your your preferred comparison output to your DMS
- Opening your Redline in Word

## How to set up a default 1-Click Compare workflow via Registry or Group Policy

    You will first need to allow the export option to be shown on your own version of Draftable Legal. You can do this via updating the Registry key changes or by Group Policy.  
        
        By updating the registry key under HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Draftable\\Feature by creating the following DWord 32 bit key `OneClickExportOptionsEnabled`with a value from 1Or by enabling the `Enable to show 1-Click export options` in Group Policy  
        
        To confirm this has worked, open Draftable, go to the settings and select the 1-Click Compare tab, in the menu you should now see a 'Copy to Clipboard' option in the top left corner (see below)
