## What's the issue?

Draftable Legal is designed to integrate and work seamlessly with Microsoft Office version 16.0, which corresponds to Office 2016. This version provides the necessary features and compatibility needed for our application to function effectively. If Office 16.0 is not installed, you might encounter limited functionality or performance issues when using our application.

## Here's the solution

To solve the issue, you need to install or upgrade to Office 16.0. Here's how you do it:
<Steps>
<Step title="Purchase Office 2016:">
Visit the Microsoft Store or another reputable software retailer to purchase Office 2016. It may be available as a one-time purchase or through a Microsoft 365 subscription.
</Step>
<Step title="Download and Install:">
Once purchased, download the Office 2016 setup file. Launch the setup file and follow the on-screen instructions to install Office 2016. Make sure to select the "Customize" option during installation to ensure Word 16.0 is installed, as it is required for our application to work optimally.
</Step>
<Step title="Update your Office Suite:">
If you already have a different version of Office installed, you might be able to update to Office 16.0 through your Microsoft 365 subscription. Go to your Office Account settings, check for available updates, and upgrade to Office 16.0 if possible.
</Step>
