## Add Draftable Legal webhook to your Worldox .ini files

<Steps>
<Step>
In your file explorer, navigate to the root directory of the Worldox install. The default location is **This PC** > **Windows (C:) > GX4.**

<Frame>
![](/images/using-draftable-legal-with-worldox/image-16.png)
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
In the **root directory** (in the example above, the GX4 folder), find the **WDUSER32.ini** file, open it and copy and paste the following text below the ----- lines

```ini
[Draftable!Open Worldox]
Active_Trigger=1
ModuleName=DraftableDesktop
ApplicationClass=HwndWrapper*
PopupClass=#32770
PopupTitle=Open Worldox
Process_Type=1
MessageID=71
[Draftable!Save Comparison Output to Worldox]
Active_Trigger=1
ModuleName=DraftableDesktop
ApplicationClass=HwndWrapper*
PopupClass=#32770
PopupTitle=Save Comparison Output to Worldox
Process_Type=2
Wait=1
MessageID=71
```
</Step>
<Step>
**Save** the file and close
</Step>
<Step>
Next, in the **root directory** find the **WDUSER.ini** file, open it and copy and paste the following text below the ----- lines

```ini
[Draftable!Open Worldox]
ApplicationName=Draftable
Title=Draftable - New Comparison from File
NotForEdit=1
Macro=&N\vf\n
CancelMacro=\c
[Draftable!Save Comparison Output to Worldox]
ApplicationName=Draftable
Title=Draftable Save Comparison Output As
Macro=\vf\vs\n
CancelMacro=\c
FileNameID=54,48,1001
```
</Step>
<Step>
**Save** the file and close
</Step>
<Step>
Lastly, in the root directory find the **WORLDOX.ini** file, open it and copy and paste the following text at the end of the document (please note: this enables the Compare button in the Worldox ribbon but will only work for users that have received an associated required update from Worldox)

```ini
[Compare Programs]
Draftable Legal=%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\DraftableDesktop\DraftableDesktop.exe "%ot" "%nt"
[Compare]
Run=OK
```
</Step>
<Step>
Changes to the WORDLOX.ini file that enable the Compare button in the Worldox ribbon will only work for users that have received an associated update from Worldox.
</Step>
<Step>
**Save** the file and close
</Step>
<Step>
You should now be able to use the Draftable Worldox integration next time you launch Worldox on your machine.
