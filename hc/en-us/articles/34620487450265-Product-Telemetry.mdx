At Draftable, our goal is to deliver the best possible experience with our product, Draftable Legal. To achieve this, we rely on telemetry data to gain insights into how our product is used, identify areas for improvement, and ensure optimal performance and reliability. By allowing us to collect and analyze telemetry data, you can help us make informed decisions that drive enhancements and innovations, ultimately benefiting your users. This document provides summary information to assist firms when deciding whether to enable telemetry sharing to support these efforts.

## Privacy and data protection

We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of privacy and data protection. Importantly:

- **No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Collected** We do not collect any personally identifiable information. This includes names, email addresses, or any other data that can be used to identify an individual.
- **No Potentially Identifiable Information Collected** Our telemetry does not capture data that can be potentially linked to specific users, licenses, IP addresses, or organizations. This ensures that all collected data is anonymized and aggregated, focusing solely on improving product performance and user experience without compromising user privacy.

By adhering to these principles, we ensure that our telemetry practices comply with privacy regulations and align with security standards expected by our users.

## How we use telemetry data

We collect product usage data to continuously improve our product and ensure it meets the needs of our users. Specifically, we aim to:

- **Enhance User Experience**  
	By understanding how users interact with our product, we can identify areas for improvement and optimize the user interface for better efficiency and satisfaction.
- **Improve Performance and Reliability**  
	Analyzing performance metrics allows us to identify bottlenecks and optimize our systems for faster and more reliable document comparisons.
- **Guide Feature Development**
	Usage data helps us prioritize new features and enhancements based on actual user needs and usage patterns.
- **Proactively Resolve Issues**  
	Monitoring error rates and user interactions enables us to quickly identify and address potential issues before they impact a broader user base.

Draftable does not use telemetry data for direct sales and marketing purposes. Data is de-identified and aggregated in a way that prevents us from using telemetry data to analyze specific customer product usage.
