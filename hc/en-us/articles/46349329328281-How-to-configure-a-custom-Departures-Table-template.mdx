## What is the Departures Table?

The **Departures Table** is a specialized report that helps you see how a document has changed—**with full context**. Instead of just showing edits inline or as redlines, it highlights the **entire section or clause** where a change occurred. This makes it easier to understand changes at a glance, especially in long or complex documents.

## What Is It Used For?

The Departures Table is typically used during collaborative editing or negotiation processes. It's especially helpful when:

- You want to **quickly review all meaningful changes** without digging through redlines.
- You're working with **large documents** and need a summary that highlights changes in full paragraphs or sections.
- You need a **clean, shareable summary** of updates to send to others for review or approval.
