Draftable Legal requires network connectivity for license verification, software updates, error reporting, and network telemetry. However, some of these functions can be disabled.

**Video Resource:** For a comprehensive understanding of Draftable network requirements, we offer our specially crafted explainer video, accessible [via this link.](/hc/en-us/articles/27925634630937-Draftable-Legal-High-Level-Overview)

## License Verification

On launch, the application will verify the product license by connecting to Draftable license servers.

| Property | Value |
|:-|:-|
| Host | draftable.com |
| Port | 443 |
| Protocol | HTTPS |
| Required | Yes |

## Software Updates

On launch, the application will check for updates. If a major update is available, it will be automatically installed. For minor updates, the user can force an update manually.

| Property | Value |
|:-|:-|
| Host | dl.draftable.com |
| Port | 443 |
| Protocol | HTTPS |
| Required | Yes |

## Error Reporting

If unexpected error conditions are encountered, the application will send an error report to Draftable servers for diagnostics purposes. 

This can be disabled by the user (via application settings) or by network administrators (via Group Policy).

| Host | draftable.com |
| Port | 443 |
| Protocol | HTTPS |
| Required | No |

## Telemetry/Usage Data

Draftable Desktop uses Microsoft Azure as the host for telemetry/usage data. Hence there are outbound connections to the Azure AppInsights servers. For further information, refer to the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/ip-addresses).

This can be disabled by the user (via application settings) or by network administrators (via Group Policy).
