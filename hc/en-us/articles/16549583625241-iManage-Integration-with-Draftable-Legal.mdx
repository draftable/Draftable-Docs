## Connecting your iManage account to Draftable Legal

Depending on what version of Draftable you are using, there are two different procedures you need to follow depending on the version.

### If you are using Draftable v25.9.300 or earlier:

Now we need to ensure that we are logging into our cloud iManage account. Navigate to the **Integrations** section of the settings menu and select **cloud.** 

Ensure you have logged into iManage on your Draftable Legal application. This can be done following the process below. 
<Steps>
<Step>
Open the settings menu and navigate to the **integrations** section of the settings.
