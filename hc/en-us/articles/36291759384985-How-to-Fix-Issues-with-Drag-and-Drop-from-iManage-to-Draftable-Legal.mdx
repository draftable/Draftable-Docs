### Cause of the issue 

When users try to drag and drop from iManage to Draftable Legal, an error can occur if iManage has not been authenticated with Draftable Legal. This issue usually surfaces after logging into the computer for the first time.

### Resolution of the issue

To resolve this issue, we have developed a new setting that triggers a login prompt for iManage to Draftable Legal when the application launches for the first time.
<Steps>
<Step>
Open the Settings Menu: via the New Comparison Window: Open the New Comparison window and select "Settings" in the top right corner

	<Frame>

	</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Enable the Setting: Locate the "Automatically trigger log in on app start" setting within the integration tab and enable it.  
	<Frame>
	  <img src="/images/troubleshooting/image-32.png" alt="Automatically trigger log in setting" />
	</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>
This setting will force users to log into iManage when Draftable Legal launches, ensuring that the drag-and-drop feature works seamlessly. If you ever do experience this issue in the future, ensure that Draftable Legal and iManage are already logged in and authenticated.
