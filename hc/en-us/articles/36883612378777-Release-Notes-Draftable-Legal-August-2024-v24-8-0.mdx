## Core Functionality Enhancements

### Enhanced File Handling with New Email and Clipboard Options

From v24.8.0, users can now save time when sharing their comparisons with the ability to rename, convert, and zip all files when emailing or copying them to the clipboard. This update allows for greater flexibility in how you share and manage documents, particularly in workflows requiring frequent document adjustments on the go.

### More export options with Single Page Export in Side-by-Side View

Effortlessly manage your comparison outputs by exporting a single page from the side-by-side view directly through the next action menus. This feature simplifies the document sharing process by enabling precise extraction of key pages for review or collaboration.

## Ease of Use Improvements

### Sticky Preferences for Consistent User Experience

Users will no longer need to manually select their file selection, renaming, and conversion preferences for every comparison. Next action preferences will now remain consistent across viewer sessions, defaulting to the last selection used. These ‘sticky’ settings ensure that your customizations persist, reducing clicks to complete your comparison and making it easier to work consistently across multiple sessions.

### New Default View Option for Redline PDF Comparisons

Optimize your review process with the new Redline Profile setting that allows the 3-pane view to be set as the default for PDF comparisons. This enhancement provides organizations or users that prefer a more detailed view of changes across older, newer and redlined documents. The setting can be configured via registry keys and Group Policy.

### Improved Error Messaging for Non-Comparable File Types

Users will now receive clearer guidance from Draftable with improved messaging for the "Draftable does not compare" filetype error. This update helps users quickly understand which file types are supported when an unsupported filetype is loaded for comparison, reducing confusion and streamlining troubleshooting.

## Performance Enhancements

### Accuracy: Improved Table Comparison Algorithm

From v24.8.0 Draftable Legal users can benefit from an updated table comparison algorithm that improves column matching accuracy. This advancement ensures that the output of tables within your documents are easier to read, reducing the work involved in reviewing comparison outputs.

### Reliability: Automatic Repair for Input DOCX Files

Enjoy greater reliability with the new auto-repair feature for DOCX documents. This function automatically corrects issues in input files with minor corruption (effectively saving a new copy of these files to remove the issue). This improvement reduces the likelihood of comparison failures and saves time by automating the workaround that would typically be provided during a support request.

### Speed: Optimized Speed for Text Comparisons in Redline Outputs

Experience faster performance in text vs. text comparisons for Redline outputs. This speed optimization allows you to complete your comparisons much more quickly than in previous versions, enhancing overall productivity.

## Administrator Features

### New Telemetry for Redline Profile, Group Policy Changes and Bulk Compare usage

As part of our commitment to continuous improvement for application administrators using Draftable, we have added new (anonymous) telemetry to log user behavior and configuration changes for Redline Profile adjustments and settings configured via Group Policy. This data will enable us to better understand the configuration needs of users which we aim to use to simplify both administrator and end user settings management.

In addition to adding Redline Profile and Group Policy events, we have also added Bulk Compare usage events to our telemetry system. We aim to use this information to guide how we further develop the Bulk Compare feature set, given the numerous additional improvements and features that can be built on top of this feature.
