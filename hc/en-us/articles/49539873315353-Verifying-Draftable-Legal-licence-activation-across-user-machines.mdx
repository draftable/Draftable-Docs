Because no per-user telemetry is sent to Draftable, and a centralised administrator portal for license and usage monitoring does not exist for Draftable, the Windows Registry is the most reliable way for administrators to confirm whether **this** workstation (and account/user) is already activated.

This article explains:

- **Where to look** in the Registry for both per-user and machine-wide installs.
- **What each value means** (activated vs not-yet-activated).
- A ready-to-run **PowerShell script** that can audit one PC, or many PCs by reading those keys remotely.


### How Draftable decides which key to read

When Draftable starts, it first checks the current user hive (**HKCU**).  
If the required value is **not** present, it falls back to the machine-wide hive (**HKLM)**.
<Info>
**Machine-wide note:** all system-scope keys live under  
`HKLM\Software\Policies\Draftable` rather than `HKLM\Software\Draftable`.
</Info>

### Registry locations and meanings

| Installer scope | Hive & path | Value name | Meaning |
| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :------ |
| Per-user (Default EXE / MSI) | `HKCU\Software\Draftable\Compare` | `ActivatedProductKey` | Present ⇒ this profile **is activated** |
| Per-user (Default EXE / MSI) | `HKCU\Software\Draftable\Compare` | `ProductKey` | Present but **ActivatedProductKey missing** ⇒ user *has not activated yet* |
| Machine-wide MSI | `HKLM\Software\Policies\Draftable\Compare` | Same two value names as above | Same meaning, but applies to **all** users on the device |

The `ProductKey` entry is also where administrators can pre-set a licence before first launch.


### Manual, one-off check
<Steps>
<Step>
 **Win + R →** `regedit`
</Step>
<Step>
 Browse to the relevant path from the table above.
</Step>
<Step>
 Look for `ActivatedProductKey` (activated) or only `ProductKey` (not yet activated).
</Step>
</Steps>
### Automated audit with PowerShell

Save this as `Check-DraftableActivation.ps1` and run it in an elevated PowerShell window.  
It defaults to the local machine; add `-ComputerName` to scan remote PCs (requires the **Remote Registry** service).

```powershell expandable
<#
  Check-DraftableActivation.ps1
  Purpose: List Draftable licence status for one or more computers.
  Usage:
      .\Check-DraftableActivation.ps1               # local machine
      .\Check-DraftableActivation.ps1 -ComputerName PC01,PC02
#>

param(
    [string[]]$ComputerName = $env:COMPUTERNAME
)

function Get-DraftableStatus {
    param($Computer)

    # Open HKU (per-user hives) on the target
    $reg = [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey]::OpenRemoteBaseKey(
               [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryHive]::Users, $Computer)

    foreach ($sid in $reg.GetSubKeyNames()) {
        $sub = $reg.OpenSubKey("$sid\Software\Draftable\Compare")
        if (-not $sub) { continue }

        $activated = $sub.GetValue('ActivatedProductKey',$null)
        $pending   = $sub.GetValue('ProductKey',$null)

        [pscustomobject]@{
            Computer   = $Computer
            UserSID    = $sid
            Activated  = [bool]$activated
            ProductKey = $activated ?? $pending
        }
    }
}

$results = $ComputerName | ForEach-Object { Get-DraftableStatus $_ }
$results | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

**What the script does**

- Enumerates each profile under **HKU**.
- Reports `Activated = True` if `ActivatedProductKey` exists; otherwise `False`.
- Works locally or remotely (requires network connectivity and permissions).
- Pipe the last line to `Export-Csv` for a spreadsheet-friendly report:

```powershell
$results | Export-Csv .\DraftableActivationAudit.csv -NoTypeInformation
```


### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| :------ | :----------- | :-- |
| No keys found for a user | Draftable has never been launched under that profile | Ask user to open Draftable once, or pre-seed a ProductKey |
| Neither HKCU nor HKLM keys exist | App installed but never run, or incorrect installer path | Verify correct installer (per-user vs machine-wide) |
| Remote script returns access errors | Remote Registry service disabled or insufficient rights | Start the service or run with elevated domain credentials |


### Next steps or further questions?

- Use the PowerShell script to audit your users' activation status, and make changes to the code for easier automation where required.
- Pair this check with Draftable’s [Group Policy templates](/hc/en-us/articles/28666057117721-Draftable-Legal-Group-Policy-Template-Files) to automate licence rollout and other settings.
