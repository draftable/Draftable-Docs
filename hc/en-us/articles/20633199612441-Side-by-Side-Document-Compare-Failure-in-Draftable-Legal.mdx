## What's the issue?

The side-by-side document compares feature in Draftable Legal is a powerful tool that allows you to view differences between two versions of a document.

However, due to the complex nature of the feature and the variety of document formats and settings it handles, issues may occasionally arise that prevent it from functioning as intended. These could be due to:

1. **Permission Issues:** The application might not have the necessary permissions to access or modify the documents.
2. **Document Corruption:** The documents being compared may be corrupted or damaged, preventing the comparison from being completed.
3. **Software Bugs:** There may be unidentified bugs in our application causing the comparison to fail.

## Here's the solution

Given the potential complexity of the issue, the best course of action is to send logs from your application to our support team for analysis. Here's how you can do it:
<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the settings section of Draftable Legal
