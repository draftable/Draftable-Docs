description: "Loading different file versions from the iManage UI can be slow and tedious. To help make this easier, once a file is loaded in Draftable, users can use “Select Version” to quickly see a list of file versions in iManage. Users can change the version loaded, or select another version of the same file to use in their comparison."

This article aims to provide how to do this for your iManage documents that have multiple versions.

## How to access document version control

First in the New Comparison window, load a document that contains multiple version from iManage. This can be first done by selecting **iManage** from the document selection window, and selecting the appropriate document.

Once the document is loaded, you will see the **Select Version** option underneath the file name. Select this text to control the version of the document needed for compare.

Here you can change the version of the document you have selected or pick the two versions you wish to compare.

Now both version documents are loaded and ready for compare. All you need to do now is hit **Compare** to compare both versions of the document.
