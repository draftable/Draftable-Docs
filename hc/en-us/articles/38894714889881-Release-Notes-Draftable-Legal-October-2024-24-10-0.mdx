## New Features & Improvements

### Core Functionality

#### PowerPoint Redline Comparison (Preview)

Users accustomed to redline markups can now easily review PowerPoint presentation files using the new **Redline in PowerPoint** Comparison Type. The Redline in PowerPoint uses a newly developed Draftable PowerPoint comparison algorithm and supports identification of changes in:

- Text (insertions and deletions)
- Tables (insertions, cell / row / column deletions, text changes within tables)
- Images (including icons, graphics and shapes)
- Speaker notes (insertions and deletions, shown without coloring)
- Slide numbers
- Whole slides (insertions, deletions)
- Grouped shapes / smart art (insertions and deletions as well as text changes)

The Redline in Draftable will use your Profile settings for markup schema (colours, text styling) and offers the ability to choose whether to compare or ignore slide elements such as text, tables, images, speaker notes, slide numbers and grouped shapes and smart art.

This feature is available in v24.10.0 as a Preview, and users interested in accessing it can contact their account representative or email product@draftable.com.

#### Summary page data and exit application option in the Comparison Viewer

To further streamline workflows, we have integrated summary page data directly into the Draftable Comparison Viewer. This makes it easier to access key comparison information without needing to switch views, helping users focus on critical changes. Additionally, we’ve introduced an 'Exit application' option in the file menu, offering a more convenient way to close the application.

#### Improved file selection UI for Draftable's Epona integration 

For users using the Epona 365 document management system, we’ve made improvements for file selection workflows in the October release. Draftable now **extends the version selector** in its Epona integration to provide more information, such as author, date and check in comments, to help users select the correct file for comparison. The file selection dialog has also been updated to make it easier to identify major and minor versions during selection.

#### Easier administration of Draftable for faster comparison workflows

**Run Draftable in silent mode without popups**

Administrators will now be able to give their end users faster compare launching by having Draftable run without users being notified by Windows (pictured). From v24.10.0, a new setting exists to disable the Windows bubble notifications on startup. This can be configured via Group Policy, reducing distractions for users during launch.

**Enable Bulk Compare for users via Group Policy**

The October release also added a Group Policy option to enable Bulk Compare for end users. This enables the General setting (shown below) that displays the 'Bulk Compare Mode' toggle in the New Comparison Window. Organizations using Group Policy can now easily ensure their teams can find this mode and run multiple document comparisons simultaneously, saving valuable time.
