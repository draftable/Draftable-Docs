title: "Using the Redline Change List to review, filter, tag, add notes and export your changes"
description: "This article outlines how to use the Change List and Changes Report when running 'Redline (.pdf)' comparisons in Draftable. These features were previously available in Side by Side comparisons and have been added to Redline (.pdf) comparisons from Draftable Legal v2.15.200 onward. This feature is not yet supported for Bulk Compare mode. Support for Change Lists in Bulk Compare will be added in future updates."
---

The Change List is an interactive list of changes found in your comparison. By default, it is shown in the Draftable PDF viewer on the right hand side of your window in the same location as the 'next actions' menu.

The Change List provides several functions to make it easier to review your comparison prior to sharing it with others or continuing drafting in MS Word. These include:

- Navigating sequentially through changes, with the relevant section of the redline being shown on screen and highlighted
- Tagging the status of changes
- Filtering changes shown by change type (e.g. insertion / deletion), content type (e.g. numbering, table, table of contents, comments) status tag or with / without notes
- Exporting the changes (including tags and notes) into a Changes Report to share with others

When selecting what is or is not shown, you have several options.  
	
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/using-draftable-using-the-redline/image-10.png)  
    </Frame>
	  
	You can filter changes based on the type of Change Type (i.e. insertions, deletions, moved text, etc)  
	
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/using-draftable-using-the-redline/image-11.png)  
    </Frame>
	  
	You can filter changes based on the type of Content Type (i.e. Text, Table of Contents, Image, etc)

Once the change list is filtered, any content on the PDF that is 'filtered' will be greyed out. For example, below shows non filtered changes:  
	
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/using-draftable-using-the-redline/image-16.png)  
    </Frame>
	And below shows 'filtered' changes:

## Tagging and leaving notes on changes

Then left-click to reveal the tagging options for that change. If you wish to tag that change with one of the tagging options, select the tag you wish to add by clicking left click again.
