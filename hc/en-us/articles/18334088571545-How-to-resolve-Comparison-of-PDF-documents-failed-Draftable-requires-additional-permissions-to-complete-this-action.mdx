Additionally, the following error message might appear in the logs:

`System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Comparison of PDF documents failed. Draftable requires additional permissions to complete this action`

## Root Cause of the Issue

Draftable's Legal Redline compare depends on Microsoft Word for certain functions. The issue arises due to a Word setting associated with converting PDF files into Word documents. This can occur when trying to compare PDF documents or raw text input.

Unfortunately, it's not possible for Draftable to change this setting on your behalf, but you can do this yourself via two different methods.
