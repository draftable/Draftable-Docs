title: "Release Notes: Draftable Legal – September 2025 (v25.9 Series)"
description: "The September 2025 releases of Draftable Legal (v25.9.0 through v25.9.300) deliver key performance, usability, and accuracy enhancements across core workflows. Customers can expect faster comparison speeds, broader language support, and more reliable document handling particularly when working with SharePoint, iManage, and complex markup scenarios."
---

Here’s a quick summary of the five most impactful improvements:

- **Work faster with PDFs and short documents** thanks to a new **Preview Mode** that speeds up comparisons for smaller files, and a new Draftable PDF to DOCX conversion engine for PDF input files
- **Use Draftable in your native language** with new support for 10 international languages in the interface
- **Easily load files via drag and drop** by resizing the new Draftable window to 1/4 of a laptop screen
- **Clean up version lists in SharePoint** by displaying **only major versions** when selecting files
- **Enforce settings across filetypes** with Group Policy for Profiles now supporting Excel and PowerPoint

Let's explore these in more detail.

**_But first, a note from our product team_**

Our product improvements are the direct result of insights from our customers. We are extremely grateful for the excellent feedback we received which allowed the September 2025 release to be possible.

If you have feature ideas or product performance feedback, we would love to hear from you. Please share any suggestions with us by contacting [product@draftable.com](mailto:[product@draftable.com).


## Performance

### Faster comparisons on shorter documents with new Preview setting

Draftable has always been optimized for comparing **large, complex documents** (30+ pages). Our comparison engine prepares all output formats (PDF, Redline in DOCX, Tracked Changes, side-by-side view) up front so you don’t have to rerun comparisons. But for **shorter documents** (1–30 pages), this upfront work can feel slower than necessary.

With version **25.9.0**, we introduced a new processing architecture called **Worker Thread Mode,** which is designed to speed up comparisons for short (up to 30 page) documents. This has been released as a **Preview feature** as it is stable for most cases, but may encounter edge-case errors. We'll be finalizing its implementation across our product suite in early 2026.

To access this preview setting, please contact your Account Executive or reach out directly to [product@draftable.com](mailto:product@draftable.com).

### Improved speed and reliability of PDF comparisons

PDF files are often a source of frustration when running comparisons. They take longer to compare and are more likely to result in errors. The 25.9.300 update included a new "Draftable Engine" option for "PDF to DOCX conversion". This new engine is faster and more reliable than the previous default Word engine, and should mean faster PDF comparisons with 25% less 'unable to compare' errors. This setting was previously available as a preview while we undertook quality assurance testing, but is now available to all users in the "General" settings tab. In some cases, users may notice this new Draftable Engine also improves layout preservation and text recognition in redline comparisons.

### Smoother workflows for Redline in Email

Early feedback on our new Redline in Email add in showed that while lawyers are loving the ability to accept / reject changes, they were running into limits when trying to generate 'clean' emails to share with clients or external parties. Our "Redline in Email" outlook add in v1.1.23 update changed how we handle images in emails to reduce the likelihood of seeing popups limiting new 'clean' email creation.

This change improves reliability when sharing comparisons directly from Draftable.

## Ease of Use

### Use Draftable in your language of choice

Firms operating in multilingual regions can now use Draftable Legal in their preferred language. The user interface now supports French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Dutch, Japanese, Polish & Tagalog.

Language settings can be adjusted via the **General** tab in Settings.

<Note>
The language for all Draftable Add Ins remains English. Support for foreign language in Draftable Add-ins will be added in future updates.
</Note>

### Enhanced window resizing for drag and drop

After feedback on the user interface design changes in our 25.8.0 release, we have updated Draftable support a smaller **minimum window resizing**. This allows users to snap Draftable into a quarter-screen view and is ideal for drag and drop workflows on laptops or smaller monitors. We also fixed a bug fix in v25.9.300 to ensure Draftable **remembers the last window size**, meaning users should not need to adjust the window sizing each time they launch Draftable.

## Integration Functions

### SharePoint: Show only major versions

A new setting allows customers using SharePoint to **filter out minor versions** when browsing document history. This helps users avoid clutter and reduces the risk of accidentally comparing or saving to an unintended version.

### SharePoint: search and performance improvements

Search operations in SharePoint have been optimized to deliver results more quickly especially in large libraries or when selecting files via the new file picker interface.

## Administrator Features

### Lock profile settings across Office formats

Administrators can now **enforce redline profile settings across Word, Excel, and PowerPoint** by locking configurations via Group Policy or Windows Registry. This improves consistency across file types and helps firms standardize output formatting across file types.

### New telemetry data for file sources and window sizing

Two new telemetry settings have been added to improve visibility into user workflows and assist with product improvements:

- **Source of loaded files** (e.g. Local, DMS, SharePoint)
- **User window resizing actions**

These logs are captured by Draftable by default (unless telemetry is turned off by your organization) and used to help identify future improvements for our product. All data is anonymized and Draftable does not capture information which can identify users or document content. To learn more about our Telemetry, visit [Product Telemetry](/hc/en-us/articles/34620487450265-Product-Telemetry).
